I have been learning Smalltalk. Smalltalk is very similar to Ruby. And Smalltalk have these great programming tools. I am particularly impressed by the object browser and it debugger. Smalltalk was designed so that the system would be learnable. If you wondered how something worked, you could inspect the object and see how it was put together.

Ruby is very similar to Smalltalk. And pry and byebug along with irb and the rails console  are a command line version of the Smalltalk debugger and object browser. Yet it requires some level of training to use it. You have to know which commands to use that belong to byebug or to ruby to get the information that you are looking for.

Although I understand that many experienced rubyists may find the command line interface for the debuggers better, a GUI front for byebug would be a great help for beginners. These biginners could be both people new to coding or experienced programmers new to Ruby, who are used to these kinds of tools.

I am hoping to have the time to create a simple prototype of what this GUI could look like, and then try it out. Who knows? Maybe I will agree with the rest of the community and decide that the command line interface is superior.
