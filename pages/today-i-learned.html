<h3>Protons</h3>
<p>Protons are made out of two up quarks and one down one.</p>
<p>Previously I was told that protons were made out of smaller particles and quarks were mentioned, but they weren't connected the way this statement is. </p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proton">protons</a></p>
<h3>Quarks</h3>
<p>Quarks are elementary particles that are fundamental part of matter. We can't look at them directly. They have been proven to exist in the last century. My current understanding is that they are like atoms of subatomic particles.</p>
<p>Reading through the article I realize how little I understand this. I think it has to do with a poor grasp of what strong and weak interactions are.</p>
<p>Previously they were presented as the cool new discover that protons, neutrons, and electrons were made out of other particles. It was similar to revealing that Pluto wasn't a planet anymore. I was taught that they were up and down quarks, but it was confusing what that meant.</p>

<h3>Physic's Standard Model</h3>
<p>This is the current theory that explains three of the four fundamental forces in the universe and that classifies elementary particles. It fails to include gravity, so it is considered a temporary theory.</p>
<p>Previously I was only barely aware of it.  </p>

<h3>Strong and Weak Interactions</h3>
<p>Strong interaction is the force that keeps particles together to form the nucleus of atoms or the force that hold quarks together to create hadron particles.</p>
<p>Weak interaction is the force responsible for radiotic decay in atoms. It is only felt at subatomic distances.</p>

<h2>22 May, 2020</h2>
<p>Autocracy is a form of government where a supreme leader or party possesses absolute power.</p>
<p>An autocracy can be a personality-driven dictatorship, an abosolute monarch, or a party dictatorship. </p>
<p>Before I thought it only meant a dictatorship.</p>
