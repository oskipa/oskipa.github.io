<h3>Musical slurs</h3>
<p>A musical <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slur_(music)">slur</a> is a line that joins two different pitches together. It is meant to indicate that you must slur the sounds together. In a piano that means playing it in legato style.</p>
<p>Previously I thought it was a strange version of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tie_(music)">tie</a>.It is confusing because the same symbol is use as a tie, which is when you have two note of the same pitch joined with the same symbol. When they have the same pitch, it indicates that you hold that note for the sum of the notes. Used when a note crosses a bar.</p>

<h3>Youtube for learning</h3>
<p>On a twitter thread I learned that one can learn how to improve many skills if you watch someone doing it on youtube. These include improving your sudoku skills, chess, monopoly, gardening, scrabble, and maybe more. I want to try it now.</p>
<p>This is the kind of tweets I liked twitter for 10 years ago. <a href="https://twitter.com/patio11/status/1264757794298789890?s=21">Learn via youtube</a></p>
<h3>Fnord and Discordians</h3>
<p>Fnord is a word with hypnotic powers which are taught to children to feel uneasy when they see it and not being able to recall it.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fnord">Fnord</a></p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discordianism">Discorcordians</a>  is a parody religion created in the 1960s. It worships chaos. I am so glad I have found this.</p>

<h3>Protons</h3>
<p>Protons are made out of two up quarks and one down one.</p>
<p>Previously I was told that protons were made out of smaller particles and quarks were mentioned, but they weren't connected the way this statement is. </p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proton">protons</a></p>
<h3>Quarks</h3>
<p>Quarks are elementary particles that are fundamental part of matter. We can't look at them directly. They have been proven to exist in the last century. My current understanding is that they are like atoms of subatomic particles.</p>
<p>Reading through the article I realize how little I understand this. I think it has to do with a poor grasp of what strong and weak interactions are.</p>
<p>Previously they were presented as the cool new discover that protons, neutrons, and electrons were made out of other particles. It was similar to revealing that Pluto wasn't a planet anymore. I was taught that they were up and down quarks, but it was confusing what that meant.</p>

<h3>Physic's Standard Model</h3>
<p>This is the current theory that explains three of the four fundamental forces in the universe and that classifies elementary particles. It fails to include gravity, so it is considered a temporary theory.</p>
<p>Previously I was only barely aware of it.  </p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_Model">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_Model</a></p>
<h3>Strong and Weak Interactions</h3>
<p>Strong interaction is the force that keeps particles together to form the nucleus of atoms or the force that hold quarks together to create hadron particles.</p>
<p>Weak interaction is the force responsible for radiotic decay in atoms. It is only felt at subatomic distances.</p>

<h3>Anthony Eden and the Suez Canal</h3>
<p>He was the prime minister of the UK after Churchill. His greatest political moment was the Suez Canal incident in the mid 1950s. It triggered the end of his political career.</p>
<p>Egypt through its president Nasser seized the Suez Canal, which was previously controlled by UK. The canal represented access to Middle Eastern oil and revenues from its tolls. Eden and his cabinet came up two plans. The first was to assisinate Nasser. The second one was to ask Israel to invade Egypt. Then UK and France would intervene to bring peace to region. They would conviniently then take over military posession of the canal.</p>
<p>Eden had not realized that UK was not a world power any more. UK owed a lot of money to the US. The US held a lot of pounds. Eden didn't consult with Americans about his plan because he felt he didn't need to. When they did consult them, their eagerness for taking over the canal made imagine US support. There wasn't any.</p>
<p>The plan started. But soon after the attack happened, the US stopped it. The US famously threatened to call the loans and to dump their holdings of pounds in the market, crashing the British economy. UK had to withdraw, bringing a humilliating political defeat.</p>
<p>Eden activated the plans to kill Nasser. But by this point Nasser had captured MI6 agents in Egypt.</p>
<p>Previously I didn't know who Anthony Eden was. I became familiar with him by watching the TV show The Crown.</p>

<h3>The Club and The Other Club</h3>
<p>Anthony Eden offended Churchill by declining to join his political dining club, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Other_Club">The Other Club</a>. To belong to this club, you had to be esteemed and entertaining. </p>
<p>Churchill created this club after he was rejected from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Club_dining_club">The Club</a>. The Club was a political dining club. It originally was meant to be a friendship dining club for Dr. Samuel Johnson. By the influence of Edmund Burke, it evolved into a political club.</p>
<h2>22 May, 2020</h2>
<p>Autocracy is a form of government where a supreme leader or party possesses absolute power.</p>
<p>An autocracy can be a personality-driven dictatorship, an abosolute monarch, or a party dictatorship. </p>
<p>Before I thought it only meant a dictatorship.</p>
