  <h2>General Notes on Developer Documentation</h2>
  <h3>Documentation as clues for discovering a system</h3>
  <label>01 December, 2023</label>
  <p>Aphorism for better developer documentation</p>
<!--break-->

<p>You write documentation for a single audience.</p>
<p>A single document for all audiences is bad documentation.</p>
<p>Developers are the audience of developer documentation. Not users. Not managers. Not project managers. Developers maintaining the system. You write for developers.</p>
<p>Your goal is to write clues to help the developer discover the system themselves. </p>
<p>Documentation are clues because it is impossible to describe the system in its entirely.</p>
<p>All projects that attempt to capture it all, will always fail.</p>
<p>Write documentation for yourself, reading it at 3 AM, fixing production.</p>
<p>Self-documented code is not enough documentation. Code describes what is happening. It can't tell you what the intention was.</p>
<p>Unit tests are not enough documentation. Tests encode requirements at a moment in time. Requirements change. </p>
<p>If your code is correct, but it looks like a mistake, write a comment explaining why it is correct and the danger of changing it.</p>
<p>Document intent. Code can be self-documenting, and appear correct, but it might do the wrong thing. Add a comment describing what you intended to do.</p>
<p>Notice when you explain verbally your system to a coworker. That is what you need to write down as documentation.</p>
<p>Describe your system in short articles. These articles should live in your repo, under a documentation folder.</p>
<p>Include the history of the project, especially when the history explains an architecture and code that look like a mistake.</p>
<p>Keep old documentation. Mark it "HISTORIC". Move it to a "history" folder if you wish. These documents give clues to the history of the system.</p>
<p>If someone asked you to explain some part of your documentation, that is a signal that you need to update that part of your documentation.</p>
<p>You grow documentation like a garden. You are never done.</p>
<p>If you prefer bullets for the main points of this entry, then
* Write for developers
* Share intent
* Describe your system
* Explain what looks like mistakes
* Tell the system's history</p>
