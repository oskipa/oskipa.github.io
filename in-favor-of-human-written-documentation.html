  <h2>In Favor of Human Written Documentation</h2>
  <h3>Write it</h3>
  <label>06 September, 2025</label>
  <p>You, the human, should write documentation when the document is meant to be useful for humans.</p>
<p>You, as a human, know your audience. You know what they know; what their background is; what they need.</p>
<p>Writing is mostly an act of empathy. We imagine ourselves as the audience. We then craft our work to their needs. We add definitions if our readers don't know them; we omit them if we know they will. We write briefly if they are busy. We add details if they needed them. This takes time, but we spend that time writing because we care about the reader.  If we do this well, we build trust. Because writing is about building relationships.</p>
<p>Using autogenerated text when it matters breaks that trust. You are sending the message that you don't care about the person. Excusing the mistakes as a bot hallucination is telling the reader that they are not worth careful proofreading and fact-checking.</p>
<p>There is some text that is never meant to be read. Especially if they are some required documentation that everyone knows will never be open. Since the task is meaningless and there are no readers, using generative text is fine.</p>
<p>If it also fine to use it if you have some kind of learning disability connected with writing. Get the first draft and then adjust it from there. I would say this is one of the most legitimate uses of the technology. Please use it.</p>
<p>Outside of those scenarios, please respect your audience and spend time exercising your empathy and building those relationships. Your life will be richer for it.</p>
