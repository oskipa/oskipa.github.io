  <h2>Successful When You Are Wrong</h2>
  <h3>The curious cases when the wrong theories can be useful</h3>
  <label>06 January, 2026</label>
  <p>This piece is a meditation on how we have fields like medicine, psychology, advertising /propaganda which were successful in their practice even though their theories are later known to be wrong. About how wrong theories have kernels of truth in them, but the explanation narrative was wrong.  </p>
<p>US school teach essay writing as a form of verbal boxing, where one states our main goal and then provides evidence to support it. This is what is expected from school assignments, op ed opinion pieces, and opinionated non-fiction writing. It is so ubiquotous in the English-speaking world that we barely ever contemplate how artificial the format is. We don't communicate like that in our daily lives. When talking about some topic, we usually share how much we like or dislike it. These positions prompt questions to deepen our bonding over how much we like something or ask why they dislike something. These kinds of conversations are more like walking in a garden, stopping in front of a rose, enjoying together, and moving on to the next flower.</p>
<p>This piece is that walk in the garden. I have no intention in boxing with your, either psychically or verbally. I cannot persuade of a position that I don't know. Instead, I am inviting you to walk around this garden or ideas, contemplate the roses, point out something that seems interesting. Whatever we come up with, the most important part will be to spend a pleasant afternoon together in conversation.</p>
<p>The garden that I want to stroll with you is how we can have a successful practice of a field using the wrong theories. We can have practical success while our explanation of the world is wrong.</p>
<p>As a child, I heard how Christopher Columbus had problems getting funding because he knew that the world was round, but the European kings knew that it was flat. Columbus persisted until the Catholic queen Isabella was convinced, so Columbus got funding to find a Western route to the Indies. This is a standard, beautiful story on how an intellectual rebel stood against society until he proved them wrong.</p>
<p>Except that this is not true. Europeans knew that the world was a sphere. They also had a good idea on how big the world was. They correctly rejected Columbus' wrong Earth circumferance calculations. Geographers of the time knew that India and the East Indies were a lot farther away. Columbus planning was wrong. Columbus was lucky that there was an unknown continent right about the place where he was going to run out of provisions. For many years he thought he reached the Philippines. It is still unclear if he died thinking so, or if he eventually realized that he reached another continent.</p>
<p>The Columbus story is not the one of a daring intellectual maverik and his enterprising royal backer, but of two dummies that got lucky. If the Americas weren't in the middle of the ocean, all of those people would have died. It was a reckless, dangerous plan that put the lives of his crew in danger. Why did Isabella fund the voyage? Perhaps she desperately wanted to catch up to the Portuguese's success in Africa. Maybe expelling the Muslims and the Jews left her without the scholars who could have exposed Columbus for the crackpot that he was.</p>
<p>Columbus' theory was wrong, but not entirely wrong. He did think the world was a sphere. His intuition was right; was a Western route to the Indies. He foolishly dismissed experts' opinions on the size of the earth. He executed a plan based on his wrong theory, and he succeded, mostly by luck. And this is the core of being right when you wrong: your theory is wrong, but has kernels of truth. When we act on the wrong theories, we end up with successful via mostly luck. The people who succeed with the wrong ideas often refused to believe that their model was incorrect.</p>
