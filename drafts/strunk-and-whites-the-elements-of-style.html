  <h2>Strunk and White's The Elements of Style</h2>
  <h3>The timeless and the obsolete</h3>
  <label>10 December, 2020</label>
  <p>Recently I joined a technical writers' Discord. There they recommened to read again Strunk and White's "The Elements of Style." I looked around my house for my old copy and read it.</p>
<p>If you went to university in the United States in the 90s, chances are that at some point an English professor assigned you this book. I don't know how popular it is outside of the United States. it is a short guide on how to write well, along with some English usage guidelines. William Strunk originally wrote it sometime during the first decade of the 1900s. E.B White updated the book in the 1950s. The book's advice is about 70 and 120 years old.</p>
<p>As I read it, I found some advice to be good to this day. Some of it seems outdated, mainly usage rules on what words to use or to avoid. I am going to share what I found timeless and obsolete.</p>
<h2>Overall view</h2>
<p>"The Elements of Style" contains useful advice about writing. It briefly tells you why you should use one rule over another. It usually has examples of bad usage versus good usage.</p>
<p>Many of the guidelines still apply to common US English. I recommend the book to anyone who is a new writer in the US. It gives a quick summary of what is considered good writing in this country. </p>
<h2>Timeless</h2>
<p>"The Elements of Style"'s is still the preffered in the US. It can be summarize as follows</p>
<h2>Obsolete</h2>
<p>There is a chapter that covers a list of word usage advice. These are the kind that tell you to use "fewer/less." </p>
