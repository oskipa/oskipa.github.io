  <h2>Protecting Your Software Skills</h2>
  <h3>Attempts to prevent losing our skills in the days of powerful autocomplete</h3>
  <label>04 February, 2026</label>
  <h3>Protecting Your Software Engineering Skills</h3>
<h4>We are what we do</h4>
<p>We are what we do. If we have a habit of doing exercise every day, we are an athlete. If we write every day, we are writer. Those who practice software engineering are software engineers.</p>
<p>Until 2023, most of our practice was centered around writing code. The practice of writing code slowed us down so that we could think about the systems that we were working on. We also learned the rough edges of our products and our technologies.</p>
<p>With the advent of large language models (LLM) creating powerful autocomplete, there has been a heavy marketing campaign, or call it propaganda, for everyone software developer to use autocomplete. Contrary to the autocomplete propaganda, the successes seem pretty modests. Yet the relentless marketing campaigns from the vendors is encouraging management to mandate the use of the tools.</p>
<p>As we eagerly, or coersevly, adopt using autocomplete, we will start losing our skills because we are not exercising them anymore. If I ask my son to work out in place of me, my son will get stronger, not me. I will become weaker the longer I outsource working out to my son. </p>
<p>As software engineers we tell each other how our real skills are about understanding complex systems and their unintented dynamics. Yet this understanding grew from writing code. The more we trust autocomplete, the more we rely on it, the more we will lose that greater context.</p>
<p>Having the field lose their skills is one of the goals of the vendors of autocomplete. It should reduce the numbers of software developers. If autocomplete doesn't work out because we finally decide it so because it becomes too expensive, then they can justify outsourcing to other countries because U.S. or European developers can no longer do the job without autocomplete. </p>
<p>It is in our best interests to protect ourselves. Even if the autocomplete revolution succeeds, one won't be able to perform at the higher level of abstractions if we lose track of the lower level components, the same way that a chess player can't win with strategy if they don't know tactics.</p>
<h4>The practices</h4>
<p>Below are a list of practices that I am doing or plan to adopt to keep myself from becoming rusty.</p>
<h5>Code By Hand</h5>
<p>Code as much by hand as you can get away with at work. Code by hand on your side project, if you are lucky to have the time to do it.</p>
<p>There is a collection of books written by Zed A. Shaw called "<a href="https://learncodethehardway.org/">Learn Code the Hard Way</a>". The main method in these books is that one types the code oneself Shaw's insight is that unless we are physically moving our bodies while typing the code, we won't learn the material well. Typing it out is what makes it learn it faster.</p>
<p>I wish I could say what is the ideal amount a day we need to hand code. I don't know. I guess I will find out.</p>
<p>** Write Your Documentation</p>
<p>Writing is thinking. Writing documentation is often seen as a chore because we have writing trauma due to how writing is taught in the U.S. and other countries with similar education system. Autocomplete generated documentation looks good enough. This is a trap.</p>
<p>Writing documentation helps us consolidate what our model of the system is. Updating documentation is not about the written artifact, it is about updating how mental image of the system.</p>
<p>If anything, the popularity of autocomplete documentation is giving us permission to write any kind of documentation that we want because it has lowered the quality threshold. A poorly written document helps us understand the system better.</p>
<p>As with writing code, it seems slow. But when it is necessary to fix the system in an emergency, we will be able to act fast if our models is fully absorbed.</p>
<p>** Focus on tests </p>
<p>Tests seem like a chore. It is usually easier to write the code than to write tests. </p>
<p>We need to understand more about the system and how it is put together to write a quick running test. We must learn edges of our computer language to create some of these tests. This is what you lose if you outsource your tests to autocomplete.</p>
<p>Our test suite is what will protect us from the errors that the autocomplete models create. We need to strengthen that protection. That is the most important part where we put the man in between.</p>
<p>It is time to review and adopt fuzzy and property based test frameworks. Look into formal verification. </p>
<p>** Sharpen templates use</p>
<p>To be able to write manual tests quickly, we need to create a library of templates that will quickly set up the testing harness because we input the key parts of the test by hand. </p>
<p>We already use templates all the time, eithe via code generators or by using libraries.  We need to lean into them more.</p>
<p>These templates are more useful if we write them ourselves, and we keep vetting them through manual review and our practice as we use them.</p>
<p>** Double down on static checkers </p>
<p>We already have a collection of static tools like linters and formatters that can find mistakes and fix them. We need to use them more heavily. Their deterministic behavior should guard against the undeterministic behavior of the autocomplete models. </p>
<p>** Stay skeptical</p>
<p>Proponents of autocomplete talk about how inevitable the use of this tool is. How the models are becoming so much better. How in six months the models will displace humans. As of early 2026, they have been saying this for the last three year.</p>
<p>Saying that something is inevitable is a common propaganda technique. The point is to kill any possibility of debate, to prevent us from thinking of alternative futures.</p>
<p>The characters that are telling us today that autocomplete will reign the future are the same that told us how we would all be wearing headsets and work in the metaverse. They told us about the wealth created by the blockchain.</p>
<p>History of tecnology disagrees with the narrative of inevitability. IDEs didn't kill vim or emacs. The Microsoft hegemony didn't prevent the emergence of the Linux comunity. Object Oriented Programming (OOP) looked like the technology hegemon for a while, yet that didn't prevent the resurgance of functional programming. Many people still write in C and in Fortran. Most of the web is powered by PHP.</p>
<p>What we see instead is a series of technologies that become popular, lose popularity, regain it. It is an ecosystem where different tools and language find their niche, often surviving a lot longer than most engineers would have ever thought. Without the massive investments in autocomplete, we would probably see the organic adoption of autocomplete near where it is the most cost-effective and useful. Eventually we will get there. We will have people who love the tool; others will use it less or ignore it, as we already see with languages, text editors, and IDEs. Yet it is hard to predict when or how we will get there when our investor ruling class is distorting the market so heavily since they want to make sure they at least regain their investment. </p>
<p>Skepticism is our tool. History is our evidence. We must keep our hope by exercising our imagination and our skills, since ground that imagination in what is possible.  </p>
<h3>Does It Matter?</h3>
<p>Luddites famously destroyed the machines of industrial investors that wanted to destroy their skilled labor in exchange for shoddy, machine made textiles. The investors won.</p>
<p>The investor class wants to do for software developemnt what the loom machines did for textiles. They have money and power. They are exercising their power of coersion as we speak. If they can convince the world that poor quality software is good enough, and there are no options, then software developers will become loom operators, if they are lucky. Most likely the loom owners will buy orphans and put them to work.</p>
<p>So this plan of mine can be futile. It may make no difference. To that I say, that is fine. That is a risk I am not only willing, but I am forced to take.</p>
<p>If someone wants to scam me, I am going to do as much as possible to protect myself. I am not going to say, "well, scammers will happen in life. Here is my credit card and social security number, Prince of the Kingdom North Eastern Wales."</p>
<p>We also need to remember that our current tech leadership have been consistently wrong for the last 15 years. They have predicted a series of inevitable technologies that have been rejected by the public and by the markets. </p>
<p>Have hope, exercise imagination, and protect yourself.</p>
