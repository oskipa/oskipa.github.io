   <h2><a href="/price-vendors.html">The Price of Renting Software</a></h2>
   <label>02 January, 2024</label>
   <p>Renting software is considered the correct solution when we face the build vs rent question. There is an army of sales and marketing teams pushing the narrative that renting is going to be cheaper and better, allowing you to focus on your core business. As the common right answer, it is safer...
   <h2><a href="/the-meta-story-of-modern-software-development.html">The meta story of modern software development</a></h2>
   <label>17 October, 2022</label>
   <p>tl/dr: Writing software is facing our ignorance and faillability. Our practices mean that we don't know what to do, and when we do, we don't trust ourselves</p>
<p>Stories are the main way in which we communicate with each other. We want stories. We want them history, yes, but we also want...
   <h2><a href="/team-programming-dialect.html">Your team's programming dialect</a></h2>
   <label>03 March, 2022</label>
   <p>We in the software developer world believe that a programming language, let's say, Python, is a single language, which will look the same everywhere. Python in particular encourages this idea with their, "there is only one way to do it" philosophy. Yet as people hop from company to company,...
   <h2><a href="/social-tech.html">The social context of technology work</a></h2>
   <label>02 March, 2022</label>
   <p>Software has a tech bias. Our culture emphasizes technology while ignoring social dynamics. We choose to lose ourselves in technological details. This gives us the option to ignore the social dynamics. Some of us do it more than others. Our current culture pushes us in that...
   <h2><a href="/frameworks-should-make-it-easy.html">Frameworks Should Make it Easy</a></h2>
   <label>03 June, 2020</label>
   <p>Frameworks should make your work easier. Yes, there will be moments when you will have to fight with the framework to get something done. These cases should be rare. In general, you should not think about a framework or be happy when using it. </p>
<p>Ideally a framework lets you get your...
   <h2><a href="/agile-self-reflection.html">Why don't we practice self-reflection in Agile?</a></h2>
   <label>01 June, 2020</label>
   <p>Self-reflection is my favorite part from agile. Call it a retrospective or a post-mortem; at the end of the day it is self-reflection. This is the self-correcting mechanism. You see what you have done. If it is not working, you do something else. If it perhaps the essence of agile. You can...
   <h2><a href="/listen-instead-of-getting-buy-in.html">Listen instead of getting buy in</a></h2>
   <label>06 May, 2020</label>
   <p>I learned recently that product owners and managers are trained to seek team members to buy-in into new process, goals, or plans. This was an unfortunate word selection. It undermines building trust in a team. It frames the relationship between managers and workers the wrong...
