   <label>12 February, 2022</label>
   <p>Recently I built a simple <a href="https://zettelkasten.de/posts/overview/">zettelkasten</a> system using vim and Ruby's <code>rake</code> library. This was an exercise in personal software.</p>
<p>Zettelkasten is a method for keeping hyperlinked notes. Its goal is to organize ideas and...

   <p>Are you an experienced developer? Have you been tasked to help out in a Rails project? Do you feel confused because there are no 'require' statements and variables seem to mushroom out of nowhere? Does Rails seem too magical to you? </p>
