   <p>I have articles on this blog that has sample code. Sometimes that sample code appears early in the article. This causes a problem with the teaser sample because sometimes the code markup breaks the rest of the list of articles, so it looks ugly and broken.</p>
<p>I recalled that in Drupal you...
   <h2><a href="/thoughts-on-pythons-iterators.html">Thoughts on Python's iterators</a></h2>
   <label>07 August, 2020</label>
   <p>I just read <a href="https://dbader.org/blog/python-iterators">Dan Bader's blog on iterators</a> [1]. Iterators were this fuzzy concept that sort of made sense, yet never did. I understood that they were there and how to use them. I read the blog, I try the example, and it clicks.</p>

   <label>05 August, 2020</label>
   <h3>tldr</h3>
<p>The *args and **kwargs parameter pattern is a way to collect an unknown number of function arguments. The names "args" and "kwargs" is a convention; the important part is the single or double star. A single star will return the arguments as a list. The double start will return...

   <label>31 July, 2020</label>
   <h3>tldr</h3>
<p><a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/doctest.html">doctest</a> [1]  is a library that allows you to write python examples in comments or text documents. This is handy because you can write examples, test them, and have the peace of mind that they work. </p>
<p>Here are...
   <h2><a href="/pythons-yield.html">Python's yield</a></h2>
   <label>30 July, 2020</label>
   <h2>The short answer</h2>
<p>Python's 'yield' is used instead of 'result' when you are creating results via a generator function. Think of generators as some sort of a lazy, stateful function that returns one item at a time. Why would we want that? We would want this when consuming a huge amount...
   <h2><a href="/pythons-with.html">Python's with</a></h2>
   <label>28 July, 2020</label>
   <h3>The point</h3>
<p>The "with" statement can be thought as syntactical sugar that replaces a try: except: finally: block with a cleaner syntax.</p>
<p>Let's focus on the practical application of with. This is an example taken from the PEP. You will see how clear the code is. What you see is...

   <label>17 July, 2020</label>
   <p>In my transition from Ruby to Python, I quickly found that there was a familiar experience that made me feel like I never left the Ruby: libraries won't work well in certain language versions.</p>
<p>The common solution for this problem is to find a version manager. For personal projects I...

   <p>I am in the process of cleaning up the site so that I can start writing again. I have decided that I will do two kinds of writing. One is very careful; I think of them as real articles. The second type are quick learning notes. My ideal site would have a section for those more well thought...

   <label>07 March, 2020</label>
   <p>I am working through the Django tutorial. Here are some thoughts.</p>
<p>There aren't any real controllers. Interesting.</p>
<p>The instant admin area is amazing. </p>
<p>Pluggable apps are such a great idea.</p>
<p>The way to define fields seems pretty straight forward. Using a more object...
