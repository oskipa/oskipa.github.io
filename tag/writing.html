   <label>28 January, 2026</label>
   <p>Recently I joined a technical writers' Discord. They recommened to read again Strunk and White's "The Elements of Style." I looked around my house for my old copy and read it.</p>

   <label>27 January, 2026</label>
   <p>Over the years, I have been in situations where I have taught how to write. I learned that the biggest problem teaching writing is not spelling or adopting the correct word usage, but the emotional stress that people experience when they write. This stress comes from how we teach: we judge...

   <label>20 July, 2020</label>
   <p>In the last year I have found it hard to write. It feels that it is hard to express what I am thinking in sentences. When I do write, I notice weaknesses in my logic; in my construction of sentences; in the grammar of the sentences; and a lot of misspellings.</p>
