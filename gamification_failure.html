  <h2>The failure of Gaminifaction</h2>
  <h3>We wanted to find a way to make daily practice a joy; we ended up creating addiction machines</h3>
  <label>18 July, 2025</label>
  <p>I enjoy games. I enjoy learning. I have enjoyed educational games since I was a child. I still like them. So it was natural that I embraced gaminification as a technique to improve my learning first, but also the learning for eveveryone else. My enthusiasm for gaminification was shared by the wider tech world, so it was an exciting time to see what smart people with funding and modern technology could accomplished.</p>
<p>Today I look at what was done: we collectively failed. Gaminification promised us a new era of engaged students and workings being motivated by game mechanics. Instead it ushered us into an era of addiction and user resentment by being manipualted.</p>
<p>What I mean as gamification is using game mechanics techniques to encourage greater engagement from students or software users. This usually transalates into getting points, earning badges, pursuing quests, and tournament ladders. The idea is simple and full of optimism. People enjoy games. What if we used games to engage students into learning? What if we use games to help us stick to our exercise routines? Or diets? Our work? Not exactly gamification, but usually closely connected to it, is modularized behavior learning. This is a curriculum that is carefully created, meant to be interactive, usually thought that we can engage in it without or with minimal help from the teacher. </p>
<p>This is not a new idea. In the US, the Sputnik era of education saw an increase of educational toys, behavioral learning via modules, and the beginning of educational technology. These games and programs waned after the US reached the moon first, using this milestone as the market that the U.S. is better at engineering that the Soviet Union, after all. The programs lingered over the decades, which is how I got to see the remanents of these games, kits, and programs. Overall, the consensus was that there were mixed results. Some programs were wildly successful, such as the Oregon Trail game. Most programs had mixed results, enough that education gave up on most of the products and techniques that were taught. No Child Left Behind, with its stress on standarized tests, pretty much killed most of these programs, only kept alive by the most ardent supporters of the techniques from teachers and families.</p>
<p>Not that these techniques were actually bad. Many of them are good, and used by the right teachers or parents, can be successful. The typing games from the 80s and 90s were pretty enjoyable, and were good at teaching touch typing. Wff and Proof was an enjoyable game of propositional logic. Bobby Fisher Teachers Chess and How to Teach Your Child to read in 100 lessons are great examples of modularized learning, where the lessons are carefully crafted and the student has instant feedback on whether they made a mistake or not.</p>
<p>But we must stress that even the successful programs and games were a great tools that supplement learning. They were not the revolutionary tools that many thought they were. They didn't speed up learning. To a large extent, even the two successful books on modularize learning are great as texts, but they still require a lot of human intervention, adapting to the actual needs of the student, clarifying concepts that the student has problems learning.</p>
