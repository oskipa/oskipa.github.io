  <h2>Reflections on Writing a Slot Machine game in Scheme</h2>
  <h3>It feels surprisingly easy and liberating</h3>
  <label>11 February, 2024</label>
  <p>This is a quick reflection on my experience writing a Slot Machine game using scheme. Specifically, I used <a href="https://www.biwascheme.org/doc/features.html">biwascheme</a> 
All in all, I am so pleased with the experience. Here is a summary of what I have learned making this game</p>
<!--break-->

<ul>
<li>I learned a lot of scheme</li>
<li>Small <em>is</em> beautiful</li>
<li>Writing my own support functions is not a problem</li>
<li>Coding was so much fun</li>
<li>I got done with coding so quickly that I could create assets and create different game settings</li>
</ul>
<p>I wanted to write a game using a lisp. I wanted to share it using the internet. I didn't want to use web assembly. I didn't want to use a transpiler. So I found <a href="https://www.biwascheme.org/doc/features.html">biwascheme</a>, which allows one to write scheme directly in html.</p>
<p><code>Biwascheme</code> implements most of r7rs small scheme, and it includes a number of handy functions, both to make programming easier and to interact with the DOM and JavaScript. It was so, so good. It took me a while to figure out how to understand the error messages, which were a bit cryptic, but soon I got the hang of it.</p>
<p>I had heard people in the 90s and 2000s complain about troubleshooting parentheses. Yes, it is a minor issue. Yet a combination of using Vim's parentheses matching feature along with some careful code reading helped a lot. Compared with having something going wrong with your Docker image, the problem is so trivial that it makes one feel that it is a first-world problem.</p>
<p>In my professional life I usually have a huge set of libraries to choose functionality from. Python, .Net, Ruby, Elixir offer a solution for most problems with their libraries. I thought that maybe I would run into an issue with <code>scheme</code>, which lacks these libraries. Surprisingly, there wasn't an issue. Writing missing functions was easy. So easy. </p>
<p>This made me think of the current state of software development. The dependency jenga that we live with is a maintenance and security problem. My small game has none of these problems because it doesn't have any external dependencies beside the language and the browser. </p>
<p>I am currently repeating the experience creating an elevator simulation.</p>
<p>Let's see how it goes. I will report in about a month.</p>
