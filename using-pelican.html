  <h2>Using Pelican</h2>
  <h3>Amazingly easy to use</h3>
  <label>08 March, 2020</label>
  <p>I am in the process of cleaning up the site so that I can start writing again. I have decided that I do two kinds of writing. One is very careful; it is essentially writing what should be real articles. The second type are quick learning notes. My ideal site would have a section for those more well thought out pieces and one for the quicker, study notes.</p>
<p>After looking for a while, I decided that Pelican should be able to make it easy for me to get these two things done.</p>
<p>I have found that I have enjoyed working with Pelican. It is easy to use and easy to customize. The documentation is superb. And if you run into something that is not covered, you can find the answer with a web search.</p>
<p>I have liked using the make command to build and publish the site. It seems to make things easier.</p>
<p>Finally, Pelican is easy to understand. After you have worked a bit, you find that most settings are python constants found in the settings page. There are few surprises, for which I am grateful.</p>
