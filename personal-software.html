  <h2>Personal Software</h2>
  <h3>Creating small sofware for personal use, again, with existing systems</h3>
  <label>12 February, 2022</label>
  <p>I have been writing personal software recently, <a href="https://small-tech.org/about/#easy-to-use">small tech</a>. Software that solves my problems in ways that adaps to how I think and work. </p>
<p>It is unpretentious software. It doesn't want to become a framework. Often, it doesn't want to become a library either. It most definitely won't become a start up. It doesn't need to run on kubernetes. It will use least amount of resources it can possibly get away with.</p>
<p>Personal software is small. It is free to grow however it wants. It doesn't need to follow team conventions. It can try new things. It can change its mind. </p>
<p>Because it is small, personal software is hackable. You can look at the source, see how it works, and change it to fit your needs. You can keep those changes if you want. You can share it with your friends if they can be helpful.</p>
<p>Personal software can be quirky. It can have silly names. It can use strange computer languages. It can have a personality.</p>
<p>Personal software is deeply human. It is literally a hand crafted tool that you use and share with others. It is not meant to be mass produced. Like crafts, it can be sold, but it is usually shared.</p>
<p>Personal software is usually shared by the creator showing people who to use it. When it has documentation, it is useful because it is a labor of love.</p>
<p>Personal software has existed for a long time. Unix was personal software. Small shell scripts are personal software. The Access forms that your cousin made for your uncle's shop is personal software. Hand-made personal websites are personal software. The minecraft mod that your buddy shared with your is personal software. The arduino sweater that lights up is personal software.</p>
<p>When we build tools for ourselves and share it with others, we are encouraging others to make their own tools too. They will want to share too. We are a sharing species.</p>
<p>What can we use? We can use Python. We can use Ruby. We can use Smalltalk Pharo. If you use it and you share it, people will do it to. As long as it is relatively easy to install and run, and you are willing to teach those who are interested, people will do it.</p>
<p>After writing this entry, I found that I was most likely inspired by <a href="https://small-tech.org/">small tech</a>.</p>
