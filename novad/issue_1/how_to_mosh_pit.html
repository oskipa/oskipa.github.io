        <h2>Sway your head to the beat</h2>
        <p>Semi close your eyes. Feel the beat. Loosen the rest of your body, especially the arms. Gently hop up and down.</p>

        <h2>Let the energy of the music take over your body</h2>
        <p>As the energy rises, so does your hopping. Start moving in small circles. Wobble. You may bump into other people. That is ok.</p>

        <h2>Mosh</h2>
        <p>Once the chorus hits, so does your body. Bump into others. Shove them. As you do this, try staying on the beat.</p>
