    <h1>Class notes</h1>
    <h2>International Ballroom Workshop, December 2024</h2>
    <p>There was an international ballroom Latin workshop in Capital Ballroom in December of 2024. These are some of my notes from those classes.</p>

    <p>The theme of the classes were better techniques that made for more comfortable and safe positions that looked good.</p>

    <h3>Rumba Walks</h3>
    <p>They taught what they called ABC balance. A is our sholder, B our hips, and C the fron foot. At the end of a step, All of these should be align in a straight line, with out weight comfortably standing on it. The back foot shouldn't have weight on it, and it should have the heel turned towards the body.</p>

    <p>The walk mechanics is to lean forward with our chest to allow gravity to move us forward. As we move forward, we move of the foot will naturally rotate the hip and naturally catch our fall. As we land, we seek the ABC balance with our hip on top of our foot.</p>


    <h3>Cha Cha Cha</h3>

    <p>We work on tripple forward and backward steps. We built on the ABC balance concept from the rumba walks and the concept of natural and comfortable positions for the body</p>

    <p>We are meant to walk forward and backwards with a slight side lead. This will help us walk in a straight line forward.</p>
    <p>The back crossed foot should comfortably be place under our shoulder, with little weight. This helps with balance and allows us to easily shift weight on it.</p>

    <p>Going back we rotate our our hips, collect our foot, place the foot behind our shoulder, and then bring the front foot back, and then perform the cha cha cha. We repeat in the other direction. This is personally what I found the hardest to do</p>

    <h3>Samba Bounce</h3>
    
    <p>This was the most illuminating session for me. It was a careful breadown in 8 counts on how to do a samba bounce in two musicall beats. It builds up in a mathematical and musical way.</p>
    
    <p>The samba beat goes 12 12. We can follow this beat thinking of it as a marching rhythm.</p>

    <p>The bounce rhythm is 1&2  1&2. We have our bent on the &s and up on the 2s.</p>

    <p>We can do break the movement into 8 counts to perform samba's sine wave motion. Instead of counting with &s we count them with numbers. The two notes are broken into 8 parts, 1234 5678.</p>

    <p>Counting this way, we want to be down on counts 2 and 6. We want to come back on 3 and 7. We want to be elevated in counts 4 and 8.</p>
