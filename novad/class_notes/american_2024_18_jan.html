            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            <ul>
              <li>Forward rock</li>
              <li>Close position -- turn left</li>
              <li><a href="#footnote-2">Lead rock back[2]</a> --> outside turn</li>
              <li>Cha cha forward</li>
              <li>Forward rock</li>

    <p id="footnote-1">[1] The turns is the cha cha. I saw leg behind and leg in front. I don't think it matters.</p>
    <p id="footnote-2">[2] This one I need to figure out. My theory is lead step back 2 and then outside turn on three. Leader's footwork (constructed): step aside on right on two, slight turn and close step with left, body weight change.</p>

      <h3>Waltz</h3>
      <p> The focus on on form. I have to figure out the position of the arms and practice that</p>
      <p>When turning to the right, lead with the foot direction, and then let the body follow. Research this. It may be that the movement starts with the body and moves with the leg too.</p>
   
      <p>In waltz you are always alternating the feel, movin the one that is free</p>
      <p>Below is a diagram with the basic figure that we are working on
