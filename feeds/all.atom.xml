It is perhaps one of the biggest hurdles that people learning English have to go through, after learning how to make the many English sounds. Yet language learners and native speakers can both share in the frustration of its spelling system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One would think that the speakers of such a hard language to write would be forgiving when people misspell words. I believe that most people are in day-to-day communication. Yet in situations that matter in people's lives, such as getting a job or doing a sales pitch, having a misspelling can bring judgement, contempt, and rejection to the unfortunate author.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like drivers, people think they are better at it than most people. Just like drivers, most people are worse than they think. Personally I have gone through periods where I believe I was an excellent speller. Then I lived through periods where I was an embarrassingly bad speller. I have fluctuated between okay and bad ever since. My lifetime spelling achievement puts me in the mediocre category.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But why? If I were consistently good, I would attribute it, like most people who are consistently good at spelling, to my superior mind and education. If I were consistently bad, I would attribute that to a poor education, or a learning disability, and secretly I would suffer thinking that I had an inferior mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But my spelling power fluctuates. Spelling inconsistently feeds my vanity and my anxieties. But why? Why? I have come with the following guesses on why my spelling is mediocre and why it varies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My misspellings go up when I am tired. For a number of years, I had bad sleep, so my spelling got worse. My sentences also become very strange. In the last few years I have used frequent misspelling as a personal alert for me to go to sleep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another trait that I have is that I seem to be a strong mimic. I will see and copy what I am exposed to. So during my college years I was exposed to a lot of professionally proofread writing, so my spelling was excellent. When I taught middle school for a year and I was exposed to kids still learning how to spell, my spelling became horrible. If I am reading in Spanish, then some Spanish spelling begins to creep in English. If I am learning another language, let's say Latin, then I adopt Latin spelling. It is not like English is the only language affected. I recently noticed that I was writing English-inspired Spanish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One solution for this mimicry side effect is that I can stop reading in other languages. Yet I enjoy that so much I am not going to stop. I need to learn how to live with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also attribute a lot of misspelling to my writing haze, this mental state where I am in a frenzy to write down thoughts. While in that state, I don't see misspellings or grammatical mistakes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yesterday I thought about another possible reason. Maybe it is a bad habit.  Perhaps internet communication, with its short, meaningless exchanges, has encouraged me to be sloppy. I don't care because the bulk of what I write online doesn't matter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am guessing that all of the above contribute to poor misspelling. Now I am trying to figure out how to improve my spelling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the key features of English spelling is that you more or less have to memorize how a word is written. The task ahead of us is one of memorization, so mnemonic tactics should be use. To better learn the spelling of words, we need to guess its origin, since English has different spelling and pronunciation rules for words that come from different languages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am planning on making a list of words I have misspelled so that I can practice those. I will probably use Anki to practice. I have been having a problem with how exactly make cards for it, since I would see the correct answer as the solution. I could write the misspelling of a word and then correct it. But then I would be exposing myself to misspellings, and my mimicry trait could learn the misspellings instead.  I could write the pronunciation transcript. Maybe it is best if I make recordings of the word and then I have to write it out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are probably spelling bee quiz programs that I can use to test myself every so often.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will try it out and report how my efforts went.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="log"></category><category term="writing"></category></entry><entry><title>Slow writing</title><link href="https://oskipa.github.io/slow-writing.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2020-07-20T00:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2020-07-20T00:00:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Hugo Estrada</name></author><id>tag:oskipa.github.io,2020-07-20:/slow-writing.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;In the last year I have found it hard to write.

It feels that it is hard to express what I am thinking in sentences. When I do write, I notice weaknesses in my logic; in my construction of sentences; in the grammar of the sentences; and a lot of misspellings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have thought a lot about this. I mainly attribute it to what I call "the writing haze." When I write, I find myself in this hazy state where I can't see grammatical mistakes or typos. I can start seeing them about 30 to 60 minutes after, once the haze goes away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I thought the solution was to revise the next day. Yet while revising I sometimes found the first draft so lacking that I would try writing a new original draft. I ended up again in the writing haze; I, once again, couldn't see errors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This morning I was thinking about it. I linked the writing haze with quick, scan reading, which also leads me to have a hazy mind which I can call "the reading haze." That reading haze so uncomfortable that about five years ago I decided to read deliberately slow. It has yielded great results. My reading retention has improved. Reading literature has once again become a vivid experience. Reading a chapter at a time lets me think about what I read, allowing me to chew on ideas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I decided to do the writing equivalent of slow reading: slow writing. Maybe if I write slowly I will avoid entering in the writing haze, the same way reading slowly prevents one from entering in the reading haze. Maybe slow writing will encourage deliberate thinking. I am hoping that will be the case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will report how well it worked some time in the future.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="log"></category><category term="writing"></category></entry><entry><title>pyenv starter pack</title><link href="https://oskipa.github.io/pyenv-starter-pack.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2020-07-17T00:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2020-07-17T00:00:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Hugo Estrada</name></author><id>tag:oskipa.github.io,2020-07-17:/pyenv-starter-pack.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;In my transition from Ruby to Python, I quickly found that there was a familiar experience that made me feel like I never left the Ruby: libraries won't work well in certain language versions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The common solution for this problem is to find a version manager. For personal projects I have been using &lt;a href="https://pypi.org/project/pipenv/"&gt;pipenv&lt;/a&gt;, which feels like an enhanced version of bundler that also handles the language version along with virtual environments. Whoa! But they are not using pyenv at work yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This week at work I learned to use pyenv. &lt;a href="https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv"&gt;Pyenv&lt;/a&gt; is a python version manager that knows how to work along with &lt;a href="https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/"&gt;virtualenv&lt;/a&gt;, python's virtual environment tool. What follows is my cheat sheet on how to use it. It is based on &lt;a href="https://realpython.com/intro-to-pyenv/"&gt;Logan Jones's article&lt;/a&gt; in Real Python [1].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Check which python versions are available&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;pyenv versions&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Install a version of python&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;pyenv install 3.6.1&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;See what versions of python you have installed&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;pyenv versions&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Create a virtual environment with a specific python version&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;pyenv virtualenv 3.3.1 chunkybacon&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;To manually activate and deactivate an environment&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;pyenv activate chunkybacon&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="err"&gt;pyenv deactivate&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;To see which environments you have&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;pyenv virtualenvs&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;If you want to learn how to install pyenv and go deeper on how to use it, please read the article that is the source of this cheat sheet.&lt;/p&gt;

Probably more worrisome is that power stupefies and absolute power stupefies absolutely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although we have been taught that intelligence is an individual trait, it is to a large extend a communal one. Humans are social animals. What we know, what we decide to spend our time on, and what ideas we have are shaped by the people we socialize.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, each person has a raw intelligence. But how effective it is depends on who their circle of peers are. I like to think about it  this way: you might have bought a Ferrari that can go 210mph, but if you only drive around city streets, your effective max speed is 30mph.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your effective intelligence is bound by who you socialize with and people feeling free to tell you that you are wrong. Assuming that you are surrounded by smart, intelligent people, let's explore how power can reduce your effective intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are many facets to power, but one of them is the ability to harm people. If you are a supervisor, a manager, or an executive, you have the ability to harm people by firing them. You may never think in those terms, or even consider firing people for disagreeing with you, but the people with less power will interact with you aware of this possibility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you can't handle bad news, different opinions, or being told that you are wrong, your subordinates quickly will pick this up and adapt to it. If you crave attention and flattery, your subordinates will grant it to you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quickly the checks-and-balances of our human group disappears. Our human brains are weak, so we start to believe that we are smarter than we are. We are more likable than we are. That we are more competent that we are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of the above is well know. What does it have to do with intelligence? If you are wrong and are not corrected by others, you will stay in the wrong. You will hold onto incorrect ideas. You will stick to bad decisions. You are that Ferrari driving on a 10mph road. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what to do? You need to build trust with your people that you can handle bad news and criticism. This is not easy, yet it is necessary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Start by stating that you welcome comments on how to improve things. Then when those comments come in, you must stay calm and thank people for the feedback. Then you  must follow through. This is tricky because you won't agree on proposed changes all the time. That is fine. You still should listen and implement changes frequently enough so that people trust that you are listening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In short, learn to listen. Your intelligence depends on it.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="article"></category><category term="management"></category><category term="leadership"></category></entry><entry><title>Frameworks Should Make it Easy</title><link href="https://oskipa.github.io/frameworks-should-make-it-easy.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2020-06-03T00:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2020-06-03T00:00:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Hugo Estrada</name></author><id>tag:oskipa.github.io,2020-06-03:/frameworks-should-make-it-easy.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Frameworks should make your work easier.

Yes, there will be moments when you will have to fight with the framework to get something done. These cases should be rare. In general, you should not think about a framework or be happy when using it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ideally a framework lets you get your work done. It makes it easy to customize some behavior. It gets out of the way in other cases. It becomes invisible when you are working with business logic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DotNet's MVC and PHP's CodeIgniter are two frameworks that meet most of these criteria. Elixir's Phoenix seems to fit it too, but I need more experience working with it to make a stronger statement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you find yourself fighting too much with the framework, it may be an indication that you may move onto something else. It may be faster and easier to write something yourself.

Call it a retrospective or a post-mortem; at the end of the day it is self-reflection. This is the self-correcting mechanism. You see what you have done. If it is not working, you do something else. If it perhaps the essence of agile. You can give up on everything, but if you keep practicing self-reflection and self-correction, you are doing it correctly. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is also the least practiced one. If practiced, it is most likely poorly done. Self-reflection is about accepting reality. Accepting reality is hard. You need three elements for self-reflection to work: maturity to accept reality, safety to point it out, and power to improve things. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If these conditions don't exist, then doing a retrospective becomes an empty ritual. In the best of cases it is a waste of time. In the worst, it can become a bullying session. In both cases it becomes unpleasant, so people will try to avoid doing it.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Accepting reality is the biggest challenge. It takes emotional maturity for individuals and organizations, which are made from those individuals. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Individually we find it painful to accept reality because we are afraid that it will shatter our self image. We may not be as productive as we were. We may have forgotten a lot about working in css. We may be struggling to learn iOS development. It is common that most of us will rather deny these realities because they force us to change the our self narrative. We avoid this pain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acknowledging these short comings can help us overcome them. If we notice we are less productive, we can start looking for the cause. Maybe we are not sleeping enough. Maybe we need to get a book on css. Maybe asking the iOS developer for help can overcome the change. Yet before we can act on the deficiencies, we need to identify and acknowledge them.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We find a similar dynamic as a group, in our teams. Even if we have team members that can handle reality, the team as a whole may not be able to do so. This is where safety and power comes into play. Those in power must make it safe to have team members bring up reality and act on suggestions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's say that a deadline was missed. The team knows it was missed because the schedule was overly optimistic. If members don't feel safe to point it out because they can be punished for doing so, they won't. People will become yes men out of necessity. Leadership will increasingly find themselves in a parallel reality where their beliefs are reality -- until reality reassesses itself, often in painful ways. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe the team can be mature enough to acknowledge reality, but they lack power to make changes. If a schedule is too optimistic, you need to add more slack to it. But the team manager may not have the power to do that. Or it was identified that the team needs training in a new technology executives decided to adopt. But they won't give them the budget. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Retrospectives then become a ritual that teaches learned helplessness. People will become jaded. They will resent the ritual because it is meaningless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In reality most of us work in places where the conditions are not ideal. What to do? As individuals we can practice self-reflection ourselves, and act within our power. If it is safe, we can model this with coworkers. This is what each of us can do to foster a culture of self-reflection and safety.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are a manager you have greater power to shape culture. There are two things that are important to create this culture. The first one is to honestly model self-reflection. The stress is on the honesty. The second one is to act on suggestions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you were responsible for the optimistic schedule, you can acknowledge that, and adjust it. Say something like, "I forgot to include slack for people getting sick" or "I didn't take into consideration the mandatory corporate retreat". Then you need to follow through fixing the schedule.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's say that in a retrospective workers say slack is too distracting, and they need 4 hours where they can turn it off so they can focus on work. The manager wants to make sure that people can still be reached within reasonable periods of time. The manager says that they can turn off slack for two hours, check messages and answer them then, and then turn it off for another two hours. The team most likely be pleased. It may not be 4 hours solid, but getting two focus segments are better than none.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We must keep in mind that power is often limited, so we can sometimes only do modest changes. Hopefully those changes can build up over time and we can then reap the benefits of self-reflection.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="log"></category><category term="software-engineering"></category></entry><entry><title>Goals over Process</title><link href="https://oskipa.github.io/goals-over-process.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2020-05-30T00:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2020-05-30T00:00:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Hugo Estrada</name></author><id>tag:oskipa.github.io,2020-05-30:/goals-over-process.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Sometimes when we learn a new methodology we become eager to implement it.

It is like buying a new board game and being eager to play it with others.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In our zeal to implement these methodologies, we may lose track that a methodology is a means to achieve a goal. The discipline is not the goal itself. Yet it is so easy to fall into the trap of making the discipline the goals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is the goal of methodologies like agile or waterfall? It is to give some organization to software development. Ideally to create working habits that give managers the information they need while giving workers predictable working environment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultimately what managers need is to know what is the state of a project in terms of completion and schedule. This is necessary to make decisions to keep a project on schedule. To a lesser extent they need to know how their workers are performing. This is necessary to identify problems and provide training if possible. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Workers need a reasonable work process. They need to have the necessary autonomy, training, and tools. They need a safe environment so that they can focus on their work rather than office politics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keeping in mind these goals, we can adapt methodology principles to actual workplaces when we join them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If a team shares their daily tasks on a slack channel, that fulfills the information needs for the  manager. There isn't a need to introduce a stand up meeting. You may love the stand up ritual, but if you force on people who don't want to do it, they will resent you for wasting their time. At the end of the day the manager is still getting the information they need.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Process is a tool. If some behavior exists that already fulfill the goal, then the pragmatic decision is to keep that behavior.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="log"></category><category term="process"></category></entry><entry><title>Find and Replace Recursively</title><link href="https://oskipa.github.io/find-and-replace-recursively.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2020-05-27T00:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2020-05-27T00:00:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Hugo Estrada</name></author><id>tag:oskipa.github.io,2020-05-27:/find-and-replace-recursively.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;grep -rl &amp;quot;Chunky&amp;quot; . | LC_ALL=C xargs sed -i &amp;quot;.bak&amp;quot;  &amp;quot;s/Chunky/Bacon/&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Every so often we need to mass edit some directories. That should be the job of sed. Yet sed doesn't find files, so you need another utility. There you have a choice of tools. For this case I decided to use grep. Although I use ack for searching patterns, I thought that grep would be the right tool here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now the explanation of the example.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;grep&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Our second favorite tool for finding patterns in files. Our favorite is ack, but grep is more appropriate here.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;-rl&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Our grep options. r = recursive search. l = output the name of the files&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;"Chunky"&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Our pattern&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;The direction we want to search. In this case, start from the current directory&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;the pipe&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;The magic unix character that lets us pass output into another command&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;LC_ALL=C&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;The esoteric incantation to have sed behave in MacOS. It has to do with encoding&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;xargs&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Unix utility to transform standard input into command arguments&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;sed&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Our batch editor&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;-i&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;The option to edit in place&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;".bak"&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;The extension that we want to give to the backup file that sed -i will create&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;"s/Chunky/Bacon/"&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;The sed command we want to execute. In this case substitute Chunky with Bacon&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can clean up the backup files with &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;grep -rl &amp;quot;Chunky&amp;quot; . | xarg rm -f&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Buy-in" sets a narrative …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I learned recently that product owners and managers are trained to seek team members to buy-in into new process, goals, or plans. This was an unfortunate word selection. It undermines building trust in a team. It frames the relationship between managers and workers the wrong way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Buy-in" sets a narrative where the manager wants something that the workers are resistant to do. The goal of the manager becomes getting that buy-in, that verbal agreement. The manager becomes a high pressure salesman. Workers are reluctant customers. A successful manager, like a high pressure salesman, making that sale no matter what. In high pressure sales, you will ignore objections. All you want is an explicit or implicit yes, even if it is not real. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A better approach is to listen. Everyone wants to succeed. As a manager you may have a vision to implement, either personal or given by your supervisors. Your workers know the obstacles that are in the way to get that done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let me give you an example. Upper management learned about threaded programming. They want the project to use threaded programming. It should make response time faster. Fair enough. You go to your team and you announce this. The team tells you that it is not a good idea because the legacy project is using Ruby, and Ruby's thread model is not robust.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the manager has a buy-in mentality, they will think that the workers are stuck in their ways. That they don't want to adapt to new ideas. The manager's task now is somehow to win them over and agree to do the task that must be done. It sets an adversarial relation with the works. It is easy to ignore what the workers are telling you because you need that win. The manager does some googling and finds that there are threads in Ruby. The devs must be ignorant and are too prideful to accept that. When an unrelated PR comes, he asks for the solution to be using threads. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's switch the frame where the manager listens respectfully. Rather than ignore what the engineers are saying, he listens. There are risks ahead. Now the manager can ask, "executives want a threaded application. How can we achieve that, then?" Then the engineers can discuss possible solutions and alternatives. Maybe what they want is concurrency, not necessarily threads. Threads is a way of gaining concurrency. If the goal is concurrency perhaps using a job framework like sidekiq is adequate. Or maybe they can try to use the new concurrency features of a future Ruby version. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In both scenarios there is a concurrency implementation. One of them was better planned out, and the team members felt respect and appreciated. The other one was ad hoc, and people are resentful for being ignored and manipulated. One sets up the team for future success. The other one can lead to a fragile product. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We all work in some sort of team. In which one would you like to be a worker in? Create that team then. &lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="article"></category><category term="software engineering"></category></entry><entry><title>How to Design a Function</title><link href="https://oskipa.github.io/how-to-define-a-function.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2020-05-05T00:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2020-05-05T00:00:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Hugo Estrada</name></author><id>tag:oskipa.github.io,2020-05-05:/how-to-define-a-function.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;This is a small template that teaches you how to write a function.

This template distills a number of great practices into a brief checklist. This short checklist, which is the core teaching of &lt;a href="https://htdp.org/"&gt;How To Design Programs&lt;/a&gt; book, concentrates writing code, documentation, tests, and thinking about your function's input range in one small checklist. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The book uses &lt;a href="https://racket-lang.org/"&gt;Racket&lt;/a&gt; as a teaching language. I am going to give an example using Ruby.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The checklist&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Write the name of the function&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Write a one-sentence comment describing what the function does&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Write the type signature&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Write an example of use in the comments&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Write tests
    a. It proves that it works
    b. It explores the boundary cases, i.e. range, incorrect types, empty lists, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Write the code&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now let's walk through a business software example. Let's say you want to insert a new blog record from an http request.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Write the name&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We write the function with its name. Nothing more.  Notice I am not writing the body or the parameters. Only write the name so that it is syntactically correct in the language that you are working on. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;def create_post()&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="err"&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Write a one-sentence comment describing the function&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This comment documents what our &lt;em&gt;intent&lt;/em&gt; for the function is. When designing a function, it helps us focus on what we are trying to write. If you can't express it in words, you can't express it in code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;# creates new post&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="err"&gt;def create_post()&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="err"&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Write the type signature &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even if you work with a dynamic language you are working with types. The point of this step is to explicitly think about what is your input and what will be your output. Statically typed languages will enforce your type signature for you. If you are using a dynamic language, you need this information to know what is supposed to be happening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The book uses the following type format. You make a list of each parameter followed by an arrow (-&amp;gt;), ending with the return type. This will be familiar to people who have studied Haskell or OCaml. If the return is void, you can say "void" or "unit".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;# creates new post&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="err"&gt;# Hash -&amp;gt; Unit  &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="err"&gt;def create_post()&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="err"&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This is an example using more idiomatic Ruby.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;# creates new post&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="err"&gt;# @param params, Hash, the http parameters hash &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="err"&gt;# @return void &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="err"&gt;def create_post(params)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="err"&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Write an example &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Writing an example of how to use your function helps you further design it. It is also one of the most helpful documentation you can add. Most people will often google for examples. Include them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;# creates new post&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="err"&gt;# @param blog_parameters, Hash, the http parameters hash &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="err"&gt;# @return void &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="err"&gt;# Example: create_post(params[:blog])&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="err"&gt;def create_post(blog_params)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="err"&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Notice how I changed the name of the parameter. I did this so that the example would be less confusing since I wanted to pass 'params[:blog]'. Thanks to writing the example, now I have a more explicit name for my function signature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Write tests&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a two part step. We are asked to write tests for the correct output and for input ranges. So the happy path and the boundary checks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's start with basic correctness when everything is right, the happy path.
    # creates new post
    # @param blog_parameters, Hash, the http parameters hash 
    # @return void 
    # Example: create_post(params[:blog])
    def create_post(blog_parameters)
    end&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;#&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;testing&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;correct&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;behavior&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;or&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;happy&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;path&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="o"&gt;#&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;The&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;test&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;is&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;ruby&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;pseudo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;code&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;test_creation&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="o"&gt;#&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;setup&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="n"&gt;params&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="err"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;title&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ss"&gt;&amp;quot;hello&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;body&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ss"&gt;&amp;quot;hello world!&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;author&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ss"&gt;&amp;quot;Joe Smith&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="err"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="o"&gt;#&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;exercise&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="n"&gt;create_post&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;params&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="o"&gt;#&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;verification&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="n"&gt;record&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;ORM&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;find_by&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;title&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ss"&gt;&amp;quot;hello&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; 
  &lt;span class="n"&gt;assert&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;record&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;nil&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;?&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;span class="k"&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This made us discover that we we have three required parameters. Now we can change our function again with this new information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;# creates new post&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="err"&gt;# @param title, String, title of the blog post &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="err"&gt;# @param body, String, body of the blog post &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="err"&gt;# @param author, String, body of the blog post &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="err"&gt;# @return void &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="err"&gt;# Example: create_post(title, body, author)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="err"&gt;def create_post(title, body, author)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="err"&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Now we can think about input violation and ranges. How short can a title be? And how short can a body be? What should happen we send a null value for author? What if the inputs are too big? Is it okay to have no author?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thinking in term of ranges helps us identify the right number of tests. This is a superior way thinking about it than old advice I was told for TDD where you kept coming up with tests until you couldn't think of any more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Write the body of the function&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now we are ready to write the body of the function. The process has made it clear what we need to do. Now we can execute.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;# creates new post&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="err"&gt;# @param title, String, title of the blog post &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="err"&gt;# @param body, String, body of the blog post &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="err"&gt;# @param author, String, body of the blog post &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="err"&gt;# @return void &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="err"&gt;# Example: create_post(title, body, author)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="err"&gt;def create_post(title, body, author)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="err"&gt;  blog = Blog.new(title, body, author) &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="err"&gt;  ORM.save(blog)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="err"&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;In the book they have created a whole library of templates for the find of work it is needed to do. Some functions require looping, so they have template looping code. If you have time, explore that library. It most likely will speed up coding if you think in those terms.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="article"></category></entry><entry><title>The Five Minutes Problem</title><link href="https://oskipa.github.io/the-five-minutes-problem.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2020-04-24T00:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2020-04-24T00:00:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Hugo Estrada</name></author><id>tag:oskipa.github.io,2020-04-24:/the-five-minutes-problem.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;In fields like chess, math, and computer science, you need to do the problem to learn.

You cannot learn just by watching a lecture. It is a skill that one must cultivate via doing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the question is, how much should you spend on a problem that you cannot solve?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One school of thought is that you keep at that problem until you can solve it by yourself. It seems to make sense. If you put enough effort, you will discover the solution. Or find a novel one. Unfortunately you may not find a solution, so you can stop playing chess or learning math if you strikingly stick to this method.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A better method is to timebox how much time you spend on solving a puzzle. The rule of thumb is that you should find the basic solution within five minutes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For those five minutes, you will attempt to solve the problem all by yourself. You have to give it your all. If you solved it, good! Pat yourself in the back!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you don't, you look at the answer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If this cheating? No. Problem solving is about pattern recognition. If you couldn't find a solution, you couldn't find a pattern. That means you haven't learned that pattern.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By spending those earnest five minutes trying to solve the problem, you will understand the problem well. You will understand why your natural solution didn't work. When you look at the solution, it is meaningful. Your emotional reaction to seeing the solution will make it easier for you to remember it, creating that desire pattern for you to recognize the next time you see a similar problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also learned this tactic by looking at the solution. I found this strategy in a chess book, which in turn adopted it from what seems to be a math teaching tactic in Russia.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="log"></category><category term="learning"></category><category term="comp sci"></category><category term="math"></category></entry><entry><title>Looping in Ruby</title><link href="https://oskipa.github.io/looping-in-ruby.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2020-04-22T00:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2020-04-22T00:00:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Hugo Estrada</name></author><id>tag:oskipa.github.io,2020-04-22:/looping-in-ruby.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Looping in Ruby is usually a delight. The idiomatic way of doing it is via #each on &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;animals.each do |beast|&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="err"&gt;  beast.roar&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="err"&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Sometimes you need the index. So you call in #each_with_index&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;animals.each_with_index do |beast, index|&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="err"&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;If you feel functional, then you can use one of the Enumerable methods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;animals.map do |beast|&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="err"&gt;  beast.roar&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="err"&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;For 90% of your looping needs, #each, or an Enumerable, #map, #select, #any?, #all?, etc, will do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are working with a queue or a stack, you can always use the classic where loop&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;where !stack.empty?&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="err"&gt;  ghost = stack.pop&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="err"&gt;  pacman.chomp(ghost)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="err"&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Yet every so often you will get to some problem where a classic for loop would be perfect. This is where it becomes awkward. Ruby doesn't have a classic for loop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a for loop. But it is not C style for loop. Instead it loops over a collection. Usually a list or a range.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is how it works. This will go by each element.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;for i in list do&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="err"&gt;  puts i&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="err"&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;In effect it is a wordy version of #each. Therefore most people use #each.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But we want a C style for! Because sometimes using indices is the right solution to a problem. Even though we don't have something just like it, we can build something close to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's say you want something like this from C#&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;var&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;list&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;Count&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;++&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;      &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;WriteLn&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;list&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;ToString&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;());&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;You can replicate it by doing something like this&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ow"&gt;in&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mf"&gt;0.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;..&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;list&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;length&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;do&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;     &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;puts&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;list&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Here we are using a range. So we will cycle through 0 to list.length - 1. We get that -1 automatically by using the ... range operator that says that we don't want to include the last number. If you wanted to include the last number, we would have written (0..list.length), but this would throw and out of range error when it got to the last item.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what do you do when you want to go backwards? We can come up with something as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ow"&gt;in&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mf"&gt;0.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;..&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;list&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;length&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;to_a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;reverse&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;do&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;puts&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;list&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Here we start with the range. We turn it into an array, and then we call reverse. Wordy? Yes. Does it get the job done? Also yes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The good news is that these are rare scenarios.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="log"></category><category term="ruby"></category></entry><entry><title>Functional Programming in OCaml, 1-2</title><link href="https://oskipa.github.io/functional-programming-in-ocaml-1-2.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2020-03-14T00:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2020-03-14T00:00:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Hugo Estrada</name></author><id>tag:oskipa.github.io,2020-03-14:/functional-programming-in-ocaml-1-2.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cs.cornell.edu/courses/cs3110/2020sp/textbook/"&gt;Functional Programming in OCaml&lt;/a&gt; is an online book compiled by Michael R.

Clarkson. It is used by Cornell University for their functional programming course.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I enjoyed reading chapter one. They explain the goals and purpose of the class that the book supports. It also has a great section on the history of the  book and the course. It tells how the class was originally based on &lt;a href="http://sarabander.github.io/sicp/html/index.xhtml#SEC_Contents"&gt;Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs&lt;/a&gt;, (SICP). From the challenges of teaching SICP, they changed languages, from Scheme to OCaml, and they developed the textbook from their class notes. This is fascinating because it is a similar experience that lead to the development of &lt;a href="https://racket-lang.org/"&gt;Racket&lt;/a&gt; and the supporting book &lt;a href="https://htdp.org/"&gt;How To Design Programs&lt;/a&gt;. I will probably talk more about how SICP, a beloved textbook, lead to the creation of other books in a future entry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chapter 2 is an introduction to OCaml as a language. I have read a number of tutorials and several chapters on other OCaml books, and "Functional Programming in Ocaml" seems to be one of the clearest explanations on the basics of OCaml. If for some reason you didn't understand the topic well enough from this text, at the end of the chapter the authors tell you which chapters from others OCaml books you should read to get an alternate explanation of the same topics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a caveat to the previous statement. It will be clear if you have a basic understanding on lambda calculus and you are familiar with how modern  mathematics defines concepts. If you are not familiar with these, the text should be more challenging. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The exercises for chapter 2 were good. You get to face the difference between integer operators such as +, -, * , /, versus the floating point operators, like +., -., * . / .. &lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="log"></category><category term="ocaml"></category><category term="notes"></category></entry><entry><title>When you Are New To Rails</title><link href="https://oskipa.github.io/when-you-are-new-to-rails.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2020-03-09T00:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2020-03-09T00:00:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Hugo Estrada</name></author><id>tag:oskipa.github.io,2020-03-09:/when-you-are-new-to-rails.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Are you an experienced developer?

Do you feel confused because there are no 'require' statements and variables seem to mushroom out of nowhere? Does Rails seem too magical to you? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If this describes you, don't worry. I have gathered this quick list of pointers to help you find your bearing. Hopefully they will make Rails more logical and less magic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Rails loads all objects found under the 'app' directory into the global scope&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is why you don't see 'require' statements. Most objects are available in the global scope.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why? Think of it as a radical kind of Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY). Whether you think this is a good idea doesn't matter. This is a Rails convention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The title statement may be a gross oversimplification. Yet it will be helpful if you assume this is true unless proven wrong. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Carefully read the error messages&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ruby errors are usually useful. They tell you what went wrong along with the location where the problem happened.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ruby's error stack trace will usually give you the file and line number where the failure has happened. This is key for solving problems. The stack trace will usually have a mix of code from our application and from Ruby libraries, commonly called gems. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Read them like this: starting from the top, scan line by line until you recognize a file from your application. Identify the file and line number, and start your debugging there. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Learn about Ruby's method dispatch and reflection&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ruby does what you expect until it doesn't. It will all seem magical and confusing unless you understand how method dispatch works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Method dispatch is Ruby's process of looking for a method definition to execute it. When you call 'batman.punch', method dispatch is trying to find where the '.punch' is. It start looking for a definition in the object's class, and then it goes up the object's ancestors. That is the basic idea.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The basic idea is also wrong. It is more complicated than that. Read this blog post to get an accurate picture: &lt;a href="https://blog.jcoglan.com/2013/05/08/how-ruby-method-dispatch-works/"&gt;How Ruby method dispatch works&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ruby has a strong reflection system. You can query a lot of information from an object. Using reflection methods is more useful if you understand how method dispatch works. But even if you don't, the following two methods will be useful right away.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;batman.inspect&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;'.inspect' gives you a string representation of the 'batman' object. Useful in the interactive ruby shell (irb), in the debugger, or  when printing to the log or a debugger via a 'puts object.inspect'.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;batman.methods&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="err"&gt;batman.methods.sort&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;'.methods' gives you an array of all of the methods that the 'batman' object can respond to.  If you add '.sort', then they will be sorted alphabetically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want more in depth information, read chapters 2 and 3 from the book &lt;a href="https://pragprog.com/book/ppmetr2/metaprogramming-ruby-2"&gt;Metaprogramming Ruby 2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The docs: Ruby Doc, Rails Guides, The Rail Way, and the source code&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://ruby-doc.org/"&gt;Ruby Doc&lt;/a&gt; should help you if you have questions about the language. The documentation is well written and useful. Ruby is programmer friendly, so if want a method to do something to an array, it most likely exists. I often consult &lt;a href="https://ruby-doc.org/core-2.7.0/Array.html"&gt;Array&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://ruby-doc.org/core-2.7.0/Hash.html"&gt;Hash&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://ruby-doc.org/core-2.7.0/String.html"&gt;String&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://ruby-doc.org/core-2.7.0/Enumerable.html"&gt;Enumerable&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://guides.rubyonrails.org/"&gt;Rails Guides&lt;/a&gt; should be your first option to learn anything about Rails. For example, if you are learning about Active Record or how to make a configuration change, you should consult this site first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can't find what you are looking for?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://leanpub.com/tr5w"&gt;The Rails Way&lt;/a&gt; should be your next stop. Look for the correct Rails version for your application. It has clear and in-depth explanations on how the different parts of Rails work. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still mystified or confused?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Read &lt;a href="https://github.com/rails/rails"&gt;Rails' source code&lt;/a&gt;. It is recommended for you to look the source code up if all of the above have failed. Read it if you are curious on how something is put together. Read it if you need to check exactly when some feature was added or removed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Use a debugger&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ruby has two popular command line debuggers, Pry and Byebug. When you add their name your code, it will open an interactive, command line  shell where you can inspect values, query the variables available in the global space, and do a lot more. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have learned about Ruby's method dispatch and Ruby's reflection methods, the debugger will help you understand how everything gets put together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The debugger is perhaps the best tool to understand Rails: use it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Identify which debugger your app is using. Learn how to use it, and learn some of its commands. If there isn't one installed, spend some time to get Byebug set up.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="log"></category><category term="ruby"></category><category term="rails"></category></entry><entry><title>Using Pelican</title><link href="https://oskipa.github.io/using-pelican.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2020-03-08T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2020-03-08T00:00:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Hugo Estrada</name></author><id>tag:oskipa.github.io,2020-03-08:/using-pelican.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I am in the process of cleaning up the site so that I can start writing again.

And Smalltalk have these great programming tools. I am particularly impressed by the object browser and it debugger. Smalltalk was designed so that the system would be learnable. If you wondered how something worked, you could inspect the object and see how it was put together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ruby is very similar to Smalltalk. And pry and byebug along with irb and the rails console  are a command line version of the Smalltalk debugger and object browser. Yet it requires some level of training to use it. You have to know which commands to use that belong to byebug or to ruby to get the information that you are looking for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although I understand that many experienced rubyists may find the command line interface for the debuggers better, a GUI front for byebug would be a great help for beginners. These beginners could be both people new to coding or experienced programmers new to Ruby, who are used to these kinds of tools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am hoping to have the time to create a simple prototype of what this GUI could look like, and then try it out. Who knows? Maybe I will agree with the rest of the community and decide that the command line interface is superior. &lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="log"></category><category term="ruby"></category><category term="metaprogramming"></category><category term="book"></category></entry></feed>
