There is an army of sales and marketing teams pushing the narrative that renting is going to be cheaper and better, allowing you to focus on your core busiess. As the common right answer, it is safer to adopt it. Without knowing anything about you or your situation, it probably is the correct answer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But. Is it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rules are thumb are good to guide our decisions. We still need to make a decision. We should verify that renting is the best to solve our problem. Verifying is critical thinking's core practice. Each problem is unique, and we need to confirm that we are making the right decision. Usually all what this means is being aware of your problem and its constraints and doing some basic arithmetic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We know what the pro-arguments for renting are. So let me list what you are giving up when renting software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Loss of control&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You don't control rented software. If it does what you want, you are fine. If it doesn't have a feature that you need, effectively you have no say on whether that feature will be added or not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The vendor will encourage you to make a feature request. If you are lucky, your request coincides with their roadmap. Then they will tell you when the feature will be released. If it is not in the roadmap, it is likely that it is never going to be there. The more clients the vendor has, the less say you will have in features. Along with features, your ability to customize the software will be limited or nonexisting. It all depends on the vendor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This lack of control can be fine. If you support a real estate company, you can live with whatever features WordPress gives you for their blog. A blog is not a core part of a real estate business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If control over the software is necessary, because being able to add new feature is crucial for your business, then seriously consider building or running it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Slower Software Development Cycles &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As long as the vendor's sofware works, you will save a lot of time and money by renting. If you need custom integration, there is a problem, or you need support from the vendor, the tasks that depend on the cycles will be slower.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Support varies from company to company. In most cases, it will be mediocre. This mediocrity has to do with the nature of SAAS: the less support offered, the more profit the product makes. There is usually a small support team that helps hundreds or thousands of customers. The more customers they have, the less reponsive they will be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When support is easy, like sending people to a website, it will be done quickly. If it is a hard problem, in the best of cases it will take time, sometimes a long time. In some cases they may even ghost you. This happened to me. Twice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It matters what capabilities you need. If you are getting weather updates from a weather API, you are safe renting; you won't run into these kinds of problems. If integrating the rented software is necessary for a key feature, you must accept that it will take longer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you need fast development, you want to consider building it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Vendor Lock-In&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many vendors will attempt to lock you as a customer. They will encourage you to mix your business rules with their product. Once you are sufficently locked-in, you lose negotiating power. You become more profitable to the vendor. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a game. You develop in such a way that you don't get locked in. This is acheived via careful planning and mindful execution. In turn, the vendors will offer custom capabilities that are so cheap that it is hard to resist not using it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vendors are counting that you, the client, don't want to pay for the above defensive programming. Small teams, small budgets, and tight deadlines will organicly encourage one to reach out to the cheap, easy to use features. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This vendor lock-in may not matter. If you are running a low traffic app on AWS, the low cost services may justify the lock in. If at some point it becomes too expensive, you are ready to rebuild somewhere else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If vendor lock-in is a threat to your business, you should consider running it yourself or building. Think of it as business protection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Costs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This may be surprising because the main selling point for SAAS is that it is going to be cheaper. You don't have to hire a software engineer to write it. You don't have to hire an operations engineer to run it. No licensing fees. No security team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Pay only for what you use" is a great idea if you barely ever use a service. For example, if you only go on a car trip once a year, renting the car for that trip is cheaper than buying a car, paying insurance, maintenance, and fuel. This "pay as go" model changes if you are using that car on a daily basis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spend 30 to 40 minutes running the numbers. How much would the total cost of running a Redmine server be vs buying Jira licenses for the whole company if you only have 30 employees? How much if your company has 1,000? Get rough estimates and look at the numbers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the cost of renting is about the same or higher than the cost for  building and running it yourself, it doesn't mean that you must build. You may still rent. You may decide to deliberately pay not build or run that service. The importance here is that it is a deliberate decision. Maybe it is more expensive to use Github than run your own gitlab instance, but you are fine paying the price so you don't do that drudgery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you decide to rent, you still have to carefully monitor your costs. Maybe you miscalculated your usage. Maybe they change the price. Or maybe you crossed some usage threshold and now the price is unacceptable. Especially today, when interest ratings are rising and SAAS companies need to pay their debts and deliver profits, you may see increases that no longer justify renting the product.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we rent software we lose control over features and price. We must be willing to accept these as part of the costs of renting. Being aware of these costs helps us to make mindful decisions. A mindless decision to build is just as bad as a mindless decision to rent. The problem is not building or renting; the problem is the mindlessness. Let us all work towards thoughtful decisions. &lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="log"></category><category term="software engineering"></category><category term="critical thinking"></category></entry><entry><title>Documentation and Dreyfus' Background</title><link href="https://oskipa.github.io/documentation-and-dreyfus-background.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2023-12-09T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2023-12-09T00:00:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Hugo Estrada</name></author><id>tag:oskipa.github.io,2023-12-09:/documentation-and-dreyfus-background.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;At some point some manager will come up with a solution for people moving away from teams and leaving with knowledge of the system.

We can document it well, so people can come and go without the team losing knowledge. We just need to be sure to document everything in our undocumented system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This plan will fail. Documentation takes time to write. When you have smaller teams, documentation usually becomes a "nice to have" rather than a "must have", so it won't get done. Or more accurately, "we will do it as soon as this urgent feature gets shipped." There is always another urgent feature to ship. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If leadership wises up and decides that no feature can ship without documentation, if documentation because a gatekeeping mechanism, the most likely scenario is that garbage documentation will be written to get a feature pushed to production.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is because when we have an undocumented system, documentation is the feature we are shipping. You can get features or documentation, but not both at the same time. Yes, people building features can always document the new feature by writing some descriptive paragraphs. Yet trying to sneak in documenting an undocumented system along with code is an act of kidding yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to document an undocumented system, create cards where the feature is the documentation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keep in mind that even if you create cards for documentation, the documentation cannot cover everything. It can't because it is not possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One explanation for this, almost a proof, comes from philosophy. Hubert Dreyfus was an American philosopher who was a Heidegger scholar. One of Heidegger's ideas about existence is we exists in a complex network of meaning. A coke bottle is meaningful to us because we understand that there is a cola drink that comes with it. Along with the drink, it carries a narrative of U.S. innovation, commercial imperialism, 20th century advertising about families, tradition, and Christmas. 40 centuries in the future, if another species find it, they will lack all of this context, and a coke bottle will be some strange bottle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The complex meaning that comes with the coke bottle is not conscious when we see it. It is unconscious, latent, but unsaid unless it is deliberately brought up. The coke bottle has different meanings in the US, where it can be seen as Americana. Whereas a Mexican it can bring up Hollywood idilic societies and eating Mexican soups like pozole or menudo which requires a Coca Cola.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Drefus calls this unconscious, complex web of meaning and contextthe background. As the coke bottle example shows, the combinations of connections of context and meanings that a single coke bottle has is stagerring. As we find new connections, those connections explode. We don't have a way to encode all of these connections. We can't do it with modern computers. We definitely can't do it with writing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In many ways, we can't share information about what we know with others. What we can do is share ideas with some context, sharing some of this context and meaning with others. The other person gets to discover it by themselves, connecting it to their own background.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This appears so abstract that it is a nice intellectual toy, a crossword puzzle for absent-minded people. It has many practical uses, though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's apply the insight of the background to documentation. Total documentation is impossible, because it is impossible to write down all the meaning of a system into writing as it stands today. It is even more difficult to encode its total history or its future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's illustrate this. You may have an internal ticketing system written in Django. You need to describe the app application. The code. All of its features, even the ones that no one uses, but maybe someone will. Who the users are. The version of Django that you are using. All the libraries that Django is using. All of the extra libraries that you installed. The version of python that it is running. The c code that runs python and many of the libraries. The version of make that is used in linux, which is the OS we use in production, but MacOS that is used for development. Describing MacOS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, that is a silly example of completeness, yet I have seen documentation that tries to approximate this. Let's say that you are only documenting your own application, leaving the documentation of the libraries to the library authors. Total documentation of your own system is still impossible. We still have an explosition of combinations of meanings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's enumerate how difficult is total documentation of just our custom systems. You need to document architecture and its changes over time. Business requirements, and their changes overtime. Document who the users are. How are they using it. Which features have bugs, but which are bugs that the users are depending on for doing their work. Document the code. Document every variable used; every piece of data. The database schemas used. The reason why we encode a Decimal as Numberic when exporting to JSON. The APIs that we are connecting to. And so and and so on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can save ourselves time and effort by acknowledging tha total knowledge is impossible due to the Background. Instead of attempting total documentation, we focus on writing documentation that makes our system discoverable. We give hints rather than exhaustive explanations. He point out tricky areas of the code, places that diverge from the conventions (and what are conventions but a technical Background?) explaining why we did so.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="log"></category><category term="documentation"></category><category term="philosophy"></category><category term="dreyfus"></category></entry><entry><title>General Notes on Developer Documentation</title><link href="https://oskipa.github.io/general-notes-on-developer-documentation.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2023-12-01T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2023-12-01T00:00:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Hugo Estrada</name></author><id>tag:oskipa.github.io,2023-12-01:/general-notes-on-developer-documentation.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Aphorism for better developer documentation&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A single document for all audiences is bad documentation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Developers are the audience of developer documentation. Not users. Not managers. Not project managers. Developers maintaining the system. You write for developers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your goal is to write clues to help the developer discover the system themselves. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Documentation are clues because it is impossible to describe the system in its entirely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All projects that attempt to capture it all, will always fail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Write documentation for yourself, reading it at 3 AM, fixing production.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Self-documented code is not enough documentation. Code describes what is happening. It can't tell you what the intention was.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unit tests are not enough documentation. Tests encode requirements at a moment in time. Requirements change. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If your code is correct, but it looks like a mistake, write a comment explaining why it is correct and the danger of changing it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Document intent. Code can be self-documenting, and appear correct, but it might do the wrong thing. Add a comment describing what you intended to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notice when you explain verbally your system to a coworker. That is what you need to write down as documentation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Describe your system in short articles. These articles should live in your repo, under a documentation folder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Include the history of the project, especially when the history explains an architecture and code that look like a mistake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keep old documentation. Mark it "HISTORIC". Move it to a "history" folder if you wish. These documents give clues to the history of the system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If someone asked you to explain some part of your documentation, that is a signal that you need to update that part of your documentation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You grow documentation like a garden. You are never done.&lt;/p&gt;

Some were so enthusiastic that they made it into a badge for being a real developer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wanted to be a real programmer, so I set off to learn them. I recall working through the tutorials for both vim and emacs during the 1990s. It was fun; it felt like I was learning a lot. Then I would close the program and keep it closed for month. My heart was initially with emacs, but my computers at the time had problems running it, so vim it was! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vim was free. Vim was small. After learning how to enter edit mode, how to write to file, and how to exit, I used vim mostly like notepad. I used it mainly for syntax highlighting and search and replace text. It also was useful for matching curly brakets. I used it like this for years. Then I learned how to navigate with the keyboard. Navigating via keystrokes was so useful, that I would install vim plugins in all IDEs that I have used over the years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throughout the years, I would learn a vim trick. Then another. I would watch someone using a macro; then I learned how to do it. When I needed some specific editing feature, I would look for it, and sure enough, there was a way of doing that in vim. I started using some plugins like NerdTree for the features that aren't built into Vim. By the time VS Code became popular, I found that I was more productive using Vim than VS Code. VS Code also used a lot of CPU cycles, making my computer hot. Vim kept it cool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started looking into Emacs again due to the popularity of Org mode. Adopting org mode was easy since it maps to how I took notes in vim. I installed evil on emacs so that I can keep using Vim key bindings. As I started to play with Common Lisp, I installed Slime to work with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I asked for help in Mastodon. Usually the biggest problem when using new technology is not knowing what you are looking for. So I would ask if there were plugins for something similar to NerdTree for Emacs. I was asked if &lt;code&gt;dired&lt;/code&gt; wasn't good enough for me. So I started using &lt;code&gt;dired&lt;/code&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wanted to increase the type size. So I learned how to start writing a config file in emacs. One does this using lisp. I am so impressed how easy it is to read lisp.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is how one learns these complex systems. You use them, you learn something, and you keep using them. If you are stuck, you reach out to others who use it too. The social part is huge, and the community is generaly helpful.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="log"></category><category term="vim"></category><category term="emacs"></category><category term="editors"></category><category term="ide"></category></entry><entry><title>Try Vim and Emacs</title><link href="https://oskipa.github.io/try-vim-and-emacs.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2023-11-13T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2023-11-13T00:00:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Hugo Estrada</name></author><id>tag:oskipa.github.io,2023-11-13:/try-vim-and-emacs.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;The Long Story&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vim and Emacs are old text editors, both created in the 1970s, about 50 years ago. Both of them have a steep learning curve. In both cases, the effort is worth it. You will learn new ways of working with text, code, and editors. You will learn tools that are free, easily available, and kind to your computer. You will become part of a long developer tradition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vim's strengths are its ubiquity, search and replace, and keyboard navigation. Vim is everywhere. If you log into any unix-like computer, chance are that vim is available. If it isn't, it is small enough that you can install it quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vim's search and replace capabilities are one of my favorites. You can search the whole file or a range of lines. You can do a find and replace via regex. You can commit to changing everything all at once, or you can set it so that it asks you for confirmation before every change. Once you understand even a little, it speeds editing so much. You can quickly find the area that you want to edit. You can make mass edits all at once.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They keyboard navigation is my favorite feature. Being able to navigate using jus the keyboard improves the speed that you can write and edit code. You can quickly find code using the search capability. Then one can get to the line and word that one needs to edit using combinations of single letter keystrokes. You can easily move lines of code around with a few keystrokes. These keystrokes are also easy on your wrists; way easier than using a mouse. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Emacs' main strength are its architecture and scripting language. Emacs has a beautiful software architecture. I can't do it justice, but I can give you enough that you will go and learn more by yourself. Each keystroke is sent to text editor server, and it is then evaluated into a command. This command may do something as simple as typing the letter 'e' in the current document, or it can format text or execute code. Emacs' power comes from this architecture. I have seen people describe emacs as a software development platform for text user interfaces (UI). That is how powerful Emacs is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Emacs' scripting language, Emacs Lisp, is what enables people to write great libraries. Lisp is simple and beautiful, and easy to learn. Emacs Lisp allows for people to write special programs that augment the power of Emacs. Emacs' libraries provide all kind of amazing features.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vim and Emacs achieve the same goals in different ways between each other, and in different ways with other common text editors or integrated development environments (IDE), such as VSCode, Visual Studio, or JetBrains editors. Being aware of the diversity of solutions to the same problem helps one pick what works for oneself. It also helps one use other editors or IDEs better, because we have an idea of what is available, and a frame of reference to compare them with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keep in mind that one doesn't have to dive in and learn everything about Vim or Emacs to start using them. Like all practices, getting some simple editing going at first is the most important step. One can learn one editing trick at a time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For years, I would use vim like notepad. I knew how to go into insert mode, I knew how to save, and how to close the program. I learned everything else little by little. My development life has been better because of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currently, I am using the same pattern to learn how to use Emacs. I am using it mainly for its Org Mode, a library that provides a lot of cool features for authoring documents and creating todo lists. You can read my &lt;a href="personal_vim_and_emacs_history.md"&gt;personal story with vim and emacs&lt;/a&gt; if you wish to learn more about how I learned and learning these editors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope that this post will encourage you to try Vim or Emacs. Even if you decide that you don't like them, you will have insights into these two developer cultures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Summary&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You should try Vim and Emacs because&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Vim is everywhere&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Vim's keybindings are easy on your wrists and increase editing productivity&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Emacs has a great architecture&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Emacs scripting language empowers you to adapt the editor to your whims&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Vim and Emacs have a great ecosystem of libraries&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Old tech has a proven track record. Vim and Emacs won't ago away&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let's explore some examples. The new CTO wants to fix all bugs within 24 hours. This is their wish. People in the company tells them that we can probably do that if we hire more developers. So the CTO sets a goal: to have 24 hour bug fixes within a year or two, the time that it would take to hire and train two the support developers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What if the tech leads explain to the CTO that the code is a mess, there is no ticketing system, and we need to add more traces to our product to make this possible? The CTO can set the 24-hour-bug-fix as a business vision, a future normal state that will take a number of years to acheive. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We end up with a business fantasy when the CTO demands that all bugs will be fixed within 24 hours, with the lack of workers and the poor state of the current system, while keeping the rest of responsibilities to develop future features and keep the current projects and deadlines. Like trying to buy a new car with 100 dollars, it can't be done. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The business fantasy becomes stronger when people who bring up reality get punished. If it is dangerous to state reality, people will pretend to believe in the fantasy, even if they don't actually believe in it personaly. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Business fantasies breed cynicism. This is because the people who run the business need to operate in reality, while publicly holding that the fantasy is real. Especially when the work that has to be done contradicts the fantasy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my opinion, the ultimate business leader who embraced fantasy was Stalin. He decided that the Soviet Union, a mostly agricultural society, was going to become an industrial country in five years. This was not possible. Those who would bring it up, would get punished because they were enemies of progress and the country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The managers that actually had to do the work would then keep two books. The ones that fed the fantasy of the leadership, that showed that there were more furniture created than there actually was, and the actual books, that kept track of the lower, real production.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everyone knew about the difference between the fantasy world and the reality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is this ongoing defense of Josef Stalin's leadership, that he industrialized USSR. This defense is similar to what current business leaders who embrace business fantasy: their out-of-reality wishes created products that many claimed couldn't be done. But this judment also belongs to business fantasy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you carefully follow the facts, the success is not as great as apologists for fantasy business leaders or Stalin make it. Their original deadlines were never met; often the more sobering timelines were better estimates than the fantastic ones. Often if the goal was achieved, it was in spite of the bad leadership, not becuase of it. And the personal suffering is too big. Stalin had the power to kill many people, and he did. Business leadership has also killed people, but we always hope that it is is at a lesser degree.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As usual, leadership has the most responsibility for creating a culture that respect reality by showing with words and deeds that they in fact respect it.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="log"></category><category term="engineering"></category><category term="business"></category><category term="software"></category></entry><entry><title>Small Steps Towards Functional Programming</title><link href="https://oskipa.github.io/small-steps-towards-functional-programming.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2022-04-05T00:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2022-04-05T00:00:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Hugo Estrada</name></author><id>tag:oskipa.github.io,2022-04-05:/small-steps-towards-functional-programming.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Functional programming has been one of those topics that is popular for developers to study for a while now.

Unfortunately most developers are not using a functional language to use at work, so this reduces the possible adoption, even when team members agree that it would make things better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The good news is that we don't have to drop Java for Haskell in one single swoop. We can adopt functional programming little by little, building functional habits. You can do this even if you work on OOP languages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The beginner's definition of functional programming&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Write programs using functions&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Follow the following rules
Write functions that are  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;small&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;return a single value&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;don't update values outside of its scope &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a gross simplification of functional programming. Yet if you start building up this habit, it will take you a long way towards functional programming. And it might make your OOP code easier to test as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Write methods that return a result&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A common pattern in a class is to have object variables that we modify in methods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;#python
  class Spaceship:
     def &lt;strong&gt;init&lt;/strong&gt;(self):
        this.shields = 10&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt; def tick(self):
    if self.is_collision():
        self.damage(1)

 def damage(self, hit_points):
    self.shields -= hit_points
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is common OOP code. &lt;code&gt;.damage()&lt;/code&gt; doesn't return a value. The pros for this style is small, understandable code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, let's make it more functional. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;#python
  class Spaceship:
     def &lt;strong&gt;init&lt;/strong&gt;(self):
        this.shields = 10&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt; def tick(self):
    if self.is_collision():
        this.shields = self.damage(this.shields, 1)

 def damage(self, shields, hit_points):
    return shields - hit_points
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now &lt;code&gt;damage()&lt;/code&gt; only does a calculation and returns the result. It doesn't depend on the object's current state. We can use &lt;code&gt;damage()&lt;/code&gt; for anything. It should be easy to test.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The dicerning reader will notice that we are still updating state. You are right! Most programs work on state, and you will always have some methods that updates state using the pure methods. These kind of methods are often called procedures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your code will improve if you do nothing else but adopt this habit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Learn the functional features for lists or arrays in your language&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most popular languages have some kind functional features around lists or arrays. You can learn how to use them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Python, learn how to work with list comprehensions. Learn the Enumerable methods in Ruby. Learn LinQ in C#.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By learning these, you are getting a good handle over the basic functional methods, &lt;code&gt;map&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;filter&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;reduce&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember to express these in an idiomatic way. Python has &lt;code&gt;map&lt;/code&gt; and  &lt;code&gt;filter&lt;/code&gt;, but currently many don't think it is idiomatic. C# should still look like C#.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Make your JavaScript more functional&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of us don't have the luxury to switch languages from Java to OCaml. But all of us have to work with JavaScript.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JavaScript accepts functions as arguments. It is such a common pattern, that we don't even think about it as something special.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In JavaScript you can write modules, bypassing objects, if you wish to do that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here you can can learn how to curry a function. If you are adveturous, you can use currying as a way to learn function composition. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Learn a functional language&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the immersion part. What we were doing before is like speaking in English and throwing in some Spanish as you practice. Sometimes you will need to jump into pool and swim. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I recommend learning Racket. Racket is a descendent of Scheme, a Lisp, and has excellent documentation. It has many capabilities, so you can craete games, scripts, web servers, or gui applications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That said, learn whatever you like. Elixir and F# also have a lot of books and documentation. Ocaml and Haskell are some other options.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This one can happen at the same time as you are adopting the previous habits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Adopt a functional language&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can do a number of functional practices in any language. But if you truly like functional programming, then you should adopt a functional language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adopt the functional language that your team likes the most. Resist the temptation of rewriting everything. Instead, create new script and software with your functional language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Beware! Keep it OOP when writing in an OOP language&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One common mistake when learning a new technique is to attempt to use it in the wrong place. Lisp is cool, but your Django code shouldn't look like it was written in Lisp. You probably can bend python enough to make it look like Lisp if you squint enough, but other people, including you in 6 months, won't understand it.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="log"></category><category term="functional-programming"></category><category term="habits"></category></entry><entry><title>Quick jinja filter in Pelican</title><link href="https://oskipa.github.io/quick-jinja-filter-in-pelican.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2022-03-21T00:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2022-03-21T00:00:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Hugo Estrada</name></author><id>tag:oskipa.github.io,2022-03-21:/quick-jinja-filter-in-pelican.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I have articles on this blog that has sample code.

This causes a problem with the teaser sample because sometimes the code markup breaks the rest of the list of articles, so it looks ugly and broken.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I recalled that in Drupal you can add a manual break by making an html comment that says "break". I looked for an existing pluging that does this in Pelican. I couldn't find it. I decided to make my own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I found this great post, &lt;a href="http://undefinedvalue.com/adding-a-jinja2-filter-with-a-pelican-plugin.html"&gt;Adding a Jinja2 Filter with a Pelican Plugin&lt;/a&gt;. It explains how to create a plugin. It is so good, that I am essentially writing this to copy the key points so that if that blog goes away, I have the notes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is so easy to create the plugin, that I am including the full code below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;    &lt;span class="c1"&gt;#python&lt;/span&gt;

        &lt;span class="n"&gt;result&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="sa"&gt;f&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;value&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;split&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;&amp;lt;!-- break --&amp;gt;&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;...&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;

        &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;result&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;add_filter&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;pelican&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;        &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sd"&gt;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;Add age_in_days filter to Pelican.&amp;quot;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="n"&gt;pelican&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;env&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;filters&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;update&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;({&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;break&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;break_text&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;})&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;register&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;():&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;        &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sd"&gt;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;Plugin registration.&amp;quot;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After you write that, you add in pelicanconf.py&lt;/p&gt;

Python in particular encourages this idea with their, "there is only one way to do it" philosophy. Yet as people hop from company to company, from team to team, from repo to repo, we see differences on how the language is used.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People react differently when they find differences. One common one is to say that some people are using Python incorrectly. You hear expressions like "it is not pythonic", "your Java is showing", "these are not best practices". If any analysis is offered, the argument usually boils down to, "you are doing it wrong; I am doing it right." This can lead to hurt feelings or even fights, depending on the personalities involved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To me, this is another place where technology discourse hides social dynamics. Having a better perception of reality helps to better discuss what is going on and how to address things. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this case, we should think of Python as a natural language, and each company or team having its own language dialect. Dialects are naturally occurring in languages used by groups of people. Developer teams are like villeges. So it will naturally occur that dialects will develop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Natural languages, like English or Spanish, are held together by common understanding, a common core of grammar, vocabulary, spelling, and idioms. Yet what people actually speak is a dialect. People speak many dialects, depending on the group of people that they are surrounded. We usually speak a family dialect, called an idiolect, where within your family you call dinner, "chum chum time." In your town your may speak Southern English. At work you will speak communicator's English. When you go to a professional conference, you speek academic and business English.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There isn't a correct English; as long as you communicate with others, every dialect or idiolect is valid. What matters is communications. Can you communicate with each other? Then it is successful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our common notion that there is a correct English and lower types of English is a matter of social behavior. In particular, of power in hierarchical societies. The dialect of the rulers becomes "the correct" dialect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is what the diversity of Pythons that you see in the world are: different dialects. Python is like English. Just like English, I, as an American, can understand someone from Australia. Yet there will be some sounds and idioms that are different. That is okay: if you really want to understand your Australian friend, you will ask questions on expressions or word you don't understand. they will do the same. Your mutual understanding will grow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I move to Australia, as an American, I can insist in writing in my teenage dialect. It is English. I may even think that an idiom, like "it's so fetch", is a good one. But they won't understand it. I may say that when an Australian says "Have a Captain Cook", that this is wrong. It makes no sense. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is what we do when we insist in using Python idioms that are not part of a repo's dialect. We are not adapting to the new environment. We are being unreasonable, more out of pride than anything else. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I propose is to approach team programming dialects the same way we approach natural languages: we adapt to make sure that we can communicate well within the group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you join a new team who heavily uses decorators, they are not doing it wrong, this is the team's dialect. Learn the idiom to adapt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Learn to gently introduce new idioms too. Let's say that you love list comprehensions, but the team doesn't use them. It doesn't matter how cool they are, or how it is so close to a mathematical way to define a set. If no one can understand your code to fix it, it is like saying "this is butter to butterflies" in an English conversation. It increases confusion, rather than understanding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why should we adpat and gently introduce new idioms? Because we need to preserve the team's dialect. And we want to preserve ours team's dialect because this is how the team has evolved to communicate with each other. In business terms, thousands of worker hours have been spent to reach this point. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we develop coding guidelines, we should keep this in mind. We should be more like linguists in that grammars describe how the language is use; not how it should be used. Same with code guidelines: it should describe the practices that are currently done in the team. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is an illusion that if we introduce coding standards, the standard will then be use to force people to adopt it. Such a project can create a lot of strife and resentment. At the end of the day it may be ignore. It may even create more inconsistencies because some people may use the standard and others don't.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And we should let languages evolve. Back to list comprehensions: maybe it didn't take off immediately, but as people tried it out, they understood it, and liked it. So now it is part of the dialect. Now it can be included in the coding guidelines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thinking about your team having a programming dialect helps to have a better perspective on how to successfully join a team and stear it towards different idioms.  &lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="log"></category><category term="software-engineering"></category><category term="software-culture"></category></entry><entry><title>Personal Software</title><link href="https://oskipa.github.io/personal-software.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2022-02-12T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2022-02-12T00:00:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Hugo Estrada</name></author><id>tag:oskipa.github.io,2022-02-12:/personal-software.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I have been writing personal software recently, &lt;a href="https://small-tech.org/about/#easy-to-use"&gt;small tech&lt;/a&gt;.

Software that solves my problems in ways that adaps to how I think and work. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is unpretentious software. It doesn't want to become a framework. Often, it doesn't want to become a library either. It most definitely won't become a start up. It doesn't need to run on kubernetes. It will use least amount of resources it can possibly get away with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Personal software is small. It is free to grow however it wants. It doesn't need to follow team conventions. It can try new things. It can change its mind. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because it is small, personal software is hackable. You can look at the source, see how it works, and change it to fit your needs. You can keep those changes if you want. You can share it with your friends if they can be helpful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Personal software can be quirky. It can have silly names. It can use strange computer languages. It can have a personality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Personal software is deeply human. It is literally a hand crafted tool that you use and share with others. It is not meant to be mass produced. Like crafts, it can be sold, but it is usually shared.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Personal software is usually shared by the creator showing people who to use it. When it has documentation, it is useful because it is a labor of love.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Personal software has existed for a long time. Unix was personal software. Small shell scripts are personal software. The Access forms that your cousin made for your uncle's shop is personal software. Hand-made personal websites are personal software. The minecraft mod that your buddy shared with your is personal software. The arduino sweater that lights up is personal software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we build tools for ourselves and share it with others, we are encouraging others to make their own tools too. They will want to share too. We are a sharing species.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What can we use? We can use Python. We can use Ruby. We can use Smalltalk Pharo. If you use it and you share it, people will do it to. As long as it is relatively easy to install and run, and you are willing to teach those who are interested, people will do it.&lt;/p&gt;

This was an exercise in personal software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zettelkasten is a method for keeping hyperlinked notes. Its goal is to organize ideas and enable connections through the hyperlinks. If you like these kinds of things, I encourage you to follow read the link above or in the references. You encode the link by create a text timestamp.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can easily implement this system by using &lt;a href="https://tiddlywiki.com/"&gt;tiddlywiki&lt;/a&gt; or something similar. I used tiddlywiki for years for my todo lists. It is a great software. Yet over the years I migrated to using mostly vim. I also wanted a doa small software project, so I went ahead and created my own. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wanted to try it out using my main writing tool, vim. I did some research to see if I could hyperlink to other files in vim. I can, using &lt;code&gt;c-tags&lt;/code&gt;, a vim feature where you create an index for string you want to hyperlink to. Then you use &lt;code&gt;ctrl-[&lt;/code&gt; when the cursor is on the text. Vim will take you to the file.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started doing all of this by hand. It quickly got out of hand. I wanted to automate the creation of the cards and the indexing. I reached out to Ruby's &lt;code&gt;rake&lt;/code&gt; library. There are some other similar libraries floating around. I know &lt;code&gt;rake&lt;/code&gt;, I wanted to focus on getting things done, so I used &lt;code&gt;rake&lt;/code&gt;, rather than learning a new library.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Rakefile has a few tasks. I can create new zettel cards, I can create an index file, and create tags. The rakefile assumes that there are some directories. The Rakefile is about 200 lines of code. It is easily hackable. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is not a complete solution. But it mine. It adapts closely to how I am currently working. It is successful enough that I have integrated the zettel system into my blog, so that I can easily nagivate between notes and writing tech articles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can &lt;a href="https://github.com/oskipa/zettel/blob/main/Rakefile"&gt;explore the code here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Tables are meant for data. Developers are misusing it for layout. It &lt;em&gt;data&lt;/em&gt; markup, not &lt;em&gt;layout&lt;/em&gt;. Use CSS for layout instead."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The wise priests listened. They looked into the CSS that the Tech Prophet had offered. They pointed out that it was hard to understand and hard to implement. The Tech Prophets cursed them out. They left and secretely kept using tables for layouts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those who remained became disciples of the Tech Prophet. The technically pure learned CSS layout. It was harder than tables, but they didn't care. What took them a few hours now took them some days to get it right. But they were technically pure. Over the years the disciples wrapped their solutions in frameworks. These frameworks used a grid metaphor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The technically pured ended up doing layouts on grids. A grid is a table. They are using tables again, although in a more complex way. That was because a grid is the right metaphor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The moral is that semantic purity can lead to an equivalent solution that is a lot more complex.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="log"></category></entry><entry><title>A Poor Philosopher</title><link href="https://oskipa.github.io/a-poor-philosopher.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2022-01-30T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2022-01-30T00:00:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Hugo Estrada</name></author><id>tag:oskipa.github.io,2022-01-30:/a-poor-philosopher.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I am a bad philosopher.

I admit that I don't have a philosophy degree. I don't write philosophy papers. I don't keep up with philosophical trends. I get paid to write business software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet it is philosophy's method the one that use the most to understand the world. It is what I do. We are what we do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am somewhat surprised by this discovery. I should be saying "engineer" since that is closer to what I get paid for. Yet I couldn't explain what the engineering method is, beside of having to build software with money, time, and quality constraints. I admire mathematics, but I am a latecomer to the discipline, still struggling with it. I was exposed early on to sociology and anthropological methods. I admired both; I don't practice either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Economics is an emotionally hard discipline for me. This is because of its close connection with propaganda, from its beginning to this day. In the twentieth century, it was used by both the USSR and the USA. Among the social sciences, it is one that attempts to apply mathematics the most, trying to gain from mathematics its prestige. It has worked to some extent: there is no Nobel prize for psychology, but there is one for economics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For all of its desire to be rigorous, economics feels shaky and wrong to me. I don't objects to its use of mathematics; I don't know enough mathematics to know whether they are used correctly or incorrectly. It is the foundational premises of the discipline and how it is used in politics that I found sloppy. Furthermore, I feel that mathematics are the sheets that conceal the shakiness of its foundation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a discipline that prides itself in rigerousness, it plays fast, loose, and reckless with its basic premises and assumptions. In fairness, it admits that it is grossly simplifying the world. Economics create a simple abstraction that is easy to comprehend. And for all of its thick sketches of reality, it is amazingly useful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What bothers me deeply is how from such a self-admiting shaky foundationyou end up with strong predictions. What starts are simple models turn into strong pronoucements on how society should be run. How we can justify complex real estate speculation because we have a model showing that it will be okay. That magically dictatorships will become democratic if we let people become rich without government supervision. If it were mare intellectual exercises, it would be fine. Yet people suffer because of these faulty intellectual exercises.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is not an attempt to show the deficiencies of economics. I don't know enough about economics to pursue that project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is sharing this because this is how I realized that I am a bad philosopher. My objections are based on the philosophical method. There is a paper about how mathematics works ridiculously well when it shouldn't. Same with philosophy. For a method that is looser than mathematics, it does surprisingly well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What am I calling the philosophical method? When you find out reality by making definitions and following their consequences through deductive logic. Looser than mathematics because we cannot start from absolute certainty. Stronger than social sciences in that attempts to get as close to mathematical-inspired logic as possible. And yet still be something of a literature genre.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I never intended to become a philosopher; less so a bad one. I somehow stumbled into it and made a habit from it. I am a bad philosopher because that is what I do. I am bad at it because that is the quality of my philosphizing. I am fine with this limitation, even when I strive to become better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I do bad philosophizing. We are what we do.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="log"></category><category term="philosophy"></category></entry><entry><title>What is good writing?</title><link href="https://oskipa.github.io/what-is-good-writing.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2020-12-14T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2020-12-14T00:00:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Hugo Estrada</name></author><id>tag:oskipa.github.io,2020-12-14:/what-is-good-writing.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;As I was writing a brief review of Strunk and White's "The Elements of Style", I began articulating what my current ideas on what good writing consists in.

I haven't thought about it for about 20 years. I realized that it had change since then. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Good writing is about empathy. You have a message you want to share with an audience. You imagine how your audience would like to hear it. You imagine yourself as the audience. You adapt your communication style for that audience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Audience is the most important consideration when writing. Audience determines the writing style, vocabulary, word usage, and even grammar. We do this out of respect and empathy for the audience. You must change your regular vocabulary, spelling, or grammar so that your audience will listen, you do it, even if it breaks the conventions of common academic English.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Good writing keeps your audience focused on your message. Anything that distracts the audience from your message is a problem with your writing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Genres and conventions help audiences to know what to expect. Priests should talk like priests. Rappers should talk like rappers. Historical fiction shouldn't have laser guns that come out of nowhere. Political commentary shouldn't break into poetry. Convention breaking pulls away from the message.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Failing to meet the audience expectations is how they get distracted. Common examples of these distractions are misspellings or grammar mistakes. Word usage can be distracting for some, when used in the wrong context. Breaking a genre convention, if not done correctly or deliberately, will be confusing and distracting. Once distracted it is hard for the audience to focus again on the message. Be empathetic: the audience is already giving their time to listen to what you have to say. Don't distract them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You want to develop the skills to write in common English so that people can focus on your message. Many will get distracted if they run into "incorrect English." People who disagree with your message will point out mistakes to distract others. These distractions often become attacks on your intelligence, your education, and your social class. Be empathetic with the rest of the audience and with yourself. Avoid this scenario in the first place. Run the spell and grammar check to avoid the biggest mistakes. Put down your draft and review it the next day. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Logical organization parallel sentences, and unambigous sentences help people understand you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Good writing is about empathy. It is having empathy towards your audience and yourself. Although the last century has focused so much about how writing is the ultimately individual act, its ultimate purpose is to share with others. It is through sharing our opinions how we help to shape others; and through others sharing their opinions how they help to shape us. Writing is the ultimate communal act.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;May your good writing help create a better world.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="log"></category><category term="writing"></category></entry><entry><title>Thoughts on Python's iterators</title><link href="https://oskipa.github.io/thoughts-on-pythons-iterators.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2020-08-07T00:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2020-08-07T00:00:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Hugo Estrada</name></author><id>tag:oskipa.github.io,2020-08-07:/thoughts-on-pythons-iterators.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I just read &lt;a href="https://dbader.org/blog/python-iterators"&gt;Dan Bader's blog on iterators&lt;/a&gt; [1].

Iterators were this fuzzy concept that sort of made sense, yet never did. I understood that they were there and how to use them. I read the blog, I try the example, and it clicks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The summary is that an iterator is an object that will give you one item from a collection at a time. Once it gets to the end, it signals that there are no more items. In Python it does this via a StopIteration exception. The "for x  in" expression seems to know how to handle these iterators.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once again, Python makes the complex easy to understand. I recall taking a C++ class. I got an A in the course. I still didn't feel confident with OOP. Then I spend some time writing a chip simulator using Python. And OOP clicked. It made sense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Python sits in a weird place. It is both an academic and an industry language. It could be that this duality allows it to a balance between making things terse enough so you can get the intention quickly, yet not too terse that you can't understand. It worked like that 20 years ago. It still works today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This example has made me think again about the Python Data Model that works along with those funky underscore methods like __iter__. They seem to be the key to this behavior. Also the key to a lot of Python's goodness. The Python Data Model will be the next think I tackle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The *args and **kwargs parameter pattern is a way to collect an unknown number of function arguments. The names "args" and "kwargs" is a convention; the important part is the single or double star. A single star will return the arguments as a list. The double start will return the argument as a dictionary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The long story&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes you need to give your function a variable number of arguments. You don't know in advance how many you are going to need. Let's say that you want to create a function that gives you the sum of some numbers. You don't know how many number there will be. That is when you use *args &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;  &amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; def sum(*args):
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;   result = 0
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;   for n in args:
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;    result += n 
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;   return result
  ...
  &amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; sum(10)
  10
  &amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; sum(10,20,30)
  60
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wouldn't it be nice if there was something similar for dictionaries? There is! That is what **kwargs is for. Let's write a function that updates a dictionary with new values.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ss"&gt;&amp;quot;apple&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ss"&gt;&amp;quot;ball&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ss"&gt;&amp;quot;cat&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;    &amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; print(&amp;quot;Hello World!&amp;quot;)
    Hello World!


    &amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; def one_plus_one():
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;   return …&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h3&gt;tldr&lt;/h3&gt;

    &amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; one_plus_one()
    2
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you can see, the key is to use the three arrows, &amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;, to write the python that you would execute in the console. The result is written lined up after the &amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; prompt. If you have a multi-line code sample, like when you are writing a function, you must enter the three dots, ... , and then line up the code as you would when writing python.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To test your code, you need to have a script that imports doctest. I looked it up on the internet. The solution I found was&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;    &lt;span class="o"&gt;%&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;python3&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;EOF&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;doctest&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;doctest&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;testfile&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;pythons_doctest.md&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;EOF&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is enough to get you going. Of course there is a lot more to it. Please consult [1] for more information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The long story&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the most awkward bits when writing about programming is writing examples in your articles and having to copy-and-past them into a script, run them, and then having to fix your article. It is not difficult. It is cumbersome. You leave a text editor to go into the console and you must add libraries and whatever you need to prepare to run the examples.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;doctest makes it easier to write your examples in the docs. Or you could write the examples on the interactive console and copy-and-paste the expressions and results into the document you are writing. I first learned about these libraries from Elixir, which encourages writing documentation with examples that can be tested with their document testing library. As I started writing these small entries on Python, I decided that it would be handy to have examples that can be tested before I publish them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Python's 'yield' is used instead of 'result' when you are creating results via a generator function. Think of generators as some sort of a lazy, stateful function that returns one item at a time. Why would we want that? We would want this when consuming a huge amount of data that can't be loaded all at once into memory. Think of a giant csv file. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the point of a generator is to have a function that can give you one item at a time and remember where it was the next time you call it.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is an example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;    &amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; # we create our generator
    &amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; def up_to_10():
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;   for n in range(10):
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;     yield n
    ...
    &amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; # we use it 
    &amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; for i in up_to_10():
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;   print(i)
    ...
    0
    1
    2
    3
    4
    5
    6
    7
    8
    9
    &amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;The longer story&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My example seems silly since we could achieve the same with a range or with a list. My guess is that generators are useful to implement laziness. You could create a library that queries a  database, but will only make the call it when you actually need it. I can also see how we can use generators to create infinite series.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'yield' trips me up coming from Ruby. 'yield' does something different in Ruby: it executes a block that has been passed to the method.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Python's 'yield' seems closer to C#'s yield. Sadly, I never fully understood C#'s yield. From this blog, it looks like it is similar to Pyton's yield. &lt;a href="https://www.kenneth-truyers.net/2016/05/12/yield-return-in-c/"&gt;https://www.kenneth-truyers.net/2016/05/12/yield-return-in-c/&lt;/a&gt;[3]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span class="w"&gt;      &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;line&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;in&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;f&lt;/span&gt;:
&lt;span class="w"&gt;          &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;print&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;line&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span class="nv"&gt;rstrip&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ss"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This would be equivalent to something like&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;  &lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;sys&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="n"&gt;f&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;open&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;/etc/passwd&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="k"&gt;try&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;line&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;f&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="nb"&gt;print&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;line&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;except&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;e&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;sys&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;exc_info&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;raise&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;e&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;finally&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;f&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;close&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you can see, using "with" is cleaner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The one catch is that the object must fit some conditions for it to work with the "with" statement. File objects since Python 2.5 meet them. You can also create objects that can play nicely along "with."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The long story&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A friend told me that I should look into Python's "with" because he said that it trips some people new to the language. I found this document doing an online search &lt;a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0343/"&gt;PEP 343, the with statement&lt;/a&gt;[1]. This document goes into detail on the evolution of the feature and how to use it. If you have time and you are interested, you should read this document.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a side note, the Python Enhancement Proposal (PEP), seems to be a great documentation project. I need to think about this and see how workplaces can adopt something like this to document design decisions over time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back to with! In practical terms, "with" is some sort of syntactical sugar that allows you to avoid writing template try: except: finally:  blocks of code. It seems similar to the "using" statement in c#. For us to be able to use a "with" statement, the object needs to support __enter__() and __exit__() methods. The PEP quoted above goes into detail on the requirements for "with" to work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you find the PEP document too overwhelming, as I did, you can also look at the following blog entry by Fredrik Lundh, &lt;a href="https://effbot.org/zone/python-with-statement.htm"&gt;Understanding Python's "with" statement&lt;/a&gt;[2].&lt;/p&gt;

It is perhaps one of the biggest hurdles that people learning English have to go through, after learning how to make English sounds. Yet language learners and native speakers can both share in the frustration of its spelling system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One would think that the speakers of such a hard language to write would be forgiving when people misspell words. I believe that most people are in day-to-day communication. Yet in situations that matter in people's lives, such as getting a job or doing a sales pitch, having a misspelling can bring judgement, contempt, and rejection to the unfortunate author.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like drivers, people think they are better at it than most people. Just like drivers, most people are worse than they think. Personally I have gone through periods where I believe I was an excellent speller. Then I lived through periods where I was an embarrassingly bad speller. I have fluctuated between okay and bad ever since. My lifetime spelling achievement puts me in the mediocre category.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But why? If I were consistently good, I would attribute it, like most people who are consistently good at spelling, to my superior mind and education. If I were consistently bad, I would attribute that to a poor education, or a learning disability, and secretly I would suffer thinking that I had an inferior mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But my spelling power fluctuates. Spelling inconsistently feeds my vanity and my anxieties. But why? Why? I have come up with the following guesses on why my spelling is mediocre and why it varies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My misspellings go up when I am tired. For a number of years, I had bad sleep, so my spelling got worse. My sentences also become strange. In the last few years I have used frequent misspelling as a personal alert for me to go to sleep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another trait that I have is that I seem to be a strong mimic. I will see and copy what I am exposed to. So during my college years I was exposed to a lot of professionally proofread writing, so my spelling was excellent. When I taught middle school for a year and I was exposed to kids still learning how to spell, my spelling became horrible. If I am reading in Spanish, then some Spanish spelling begins to creep in English. If I am learning another language, let's say Latin, then I adopt Latin spelling. It is not like English is the only language affected. I recently noticed that I was writing English-inspired Spanish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One solution for this mimicry side effect is that I can stop reading in other languages. Yet I enjoy that so much I am not going to stop. I need to learn how to live with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also attribute a lot of misspelling to my writing haze, this mental state where I am in a frenzy to write down thoughts. While in this state, I don't see misspellings or grammatical mistakes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yesterday I thought about another possible reason. Maybe it is a bad habit.  Perhaps internet communication, with its short, meaningless exchanges, has encouraged me to be sloppy. I don't care because the bulk of what I write online doesn't matter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am guessing that all the above contribute to poor misspelling. Now I am trying to figure out how to improve my spelling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the key features of English spelling is that you more or less have to memorize how a word is written. The task ahead of us is one of memorization, so mnemonic tactics should be use. To better learn the spelling of words, we need to guess its origin, since English has different spelling and pronunciation rules for words that come from different languages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am planning on making a list of words I have misspelled so that I can practice those. I will probably use Anki to practice. I have been having a problem with how exactly make cards for it, since I would see the correct answer as the solution. Or I could write the misspelling of a word and then correct it. But then I would be exposing myself to misspellings, and my mimicry trait could learn the misspellings instead. I could also write the pronunciation transcript. Maybe it is best if I make recordings of the word and then I have to write it out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are probably spelling bee quiz programs that I can use to test myself every so often.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will try it out and report how my efforts went.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="log"></category><category term="writing"></category></entry><entry><title>Slow writing</title><link href="https://oskipa.github.io/slow-writing.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2020-07-20T00:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2020-07-20T00:00:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Hugo Estrada</name></author><id>tag:oskipa.github.io,2020-07-20:/slow-writing.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;In the last year I have found it hard to write.

It feels that it is hard to express what I am thinking in sentences. When I do write, I notice weaknesses in my logic; in my construction of sentences; in the grammar of the sentences; and a lot of misspellings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have thought a lot about this. I mainly attribute it to what I call "the writing haze." When I write, I find myself in this hazy state where I can't see grammatical mistakes or typos. I can start seeing them about 30 to 60 minutes after, once the haze goes away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I thought the solution was to revise the next day. Yet while revising I sometimes found the first draft so lacking that I would try writing a new original draft. I ended up again in the writing haze; I, once again, couldn't see errors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This morning I was thinking about it. I linked the writing haze with quick, scan reading, which also leads me to have a hazy mind which I can call "the reading haze." That reading haze so uncomfortable that about five years ago I decided to read deliberately slow. It has yielded great results. My reading retention has improved. Reading literature has once again become a vivid experience. Reading a chapter at a time lets me think about what I read, allowing me to chew on ideas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I decided to do the writing equivalent of slow reading: slow writing. Maybe if I write slowly I will avoid entering in the writing haze, the same way reading slowly prevents one from entering in the reading haze. Maybe slow writing will encourage deliberate thinking. I am hoping that will be the case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will report how well it worked some time in the future.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="log"></category><category term="writing"></category></entry><entry><title>pyenv starter pack</title><link href="https://oskipa.github.io/pyenv-starter-pack.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2020-07-17T00:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2020-07-17T00:00:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Hugo Estrada</name></author><id>tag:oskipa.github.io,2020-07-17:/pyenv-starter-pack.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;In my transition from Ruby to Python, I quickly found that there was a familiar experience that made me feel like I never left the Ruby: libraries won't work well in certain language versions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The common solution for this problem is to find a version manager. For personal projects I have been using &lt;a href="https://pypi.org/project/pipenv/"&gt;pipenv&lt;/a&gt;, which feels like an enhanced version of bundler that also handles the language version along with virtual environments. Whoa! But they are not using pyenv at work yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This week at work I learned to use pyenv. &lt;a href="https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv"&gt;Pyenv&lt;/a&gt; is a python version manager that knows how to work along with &lt;a href="https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/"&gt;virtualenv&lt;/a&gt;, python's virtual environment tool. What follows is my cheat sheet on how to use it. It is based on &lt;a href="https://realpython.com/intro-to-pyenv/"&gt;Logan Jones's article&lt;/a&gt; in Real Python [1].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Check which python versions are available&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;pyenv versions
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Install a version of python&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;pyenv install 3.6.1
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;See what versions of python you have installed&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;pyenv versions
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Create a virtual environment with a specific python version&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;pyenv virtualenv 3.3.1 chunkybacon
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To manually activate and deactivate an environment&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;pyenv activate chunkybacon
pyenv deactivate
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To see which environments you have&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;pyenv virtualenvs
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Call it a retrospective or a post-mortem; at the end of the day it is self-reflection. This is the self-correcting mechanism. You see what you have done. If it is not working, you do something else. If it perhaps the essence of agile. You can give up on everything, but if you keep practicing self-reflection and self-correction, you are doing it correctly. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is also the least practiced one. If practiced, it is most likely poorly done. Self-reflection is about accepting reality. Accepting reality is hard. You need three elements for self-reflection to work: maturity to accept reality, safety to point it out, and power to improve things. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If these conditions don't exist, then doing a retrospective becomes an empty ritual. In the best of cases it is a waste of time. In the worst, it can become a bullying session. In both cases it becomes unpleasant, so people will try to avoid doing it.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Accepting reality is the biggest challenge. It takes emotional maturity for individuals and organizations, which are made from those individuals. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Individually we find it painful to accept reality because we are afraid that it will shatter our self image. We may not be as productive as we were. We may have forgotten a lot about working in css. We may be struggling to learn iOS development. It is common that most of us will rather deny these realities because they force us to change the our self narrative. We avoid this pain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acknowledging these short comings can help us overcome them. If we notice we are less productive, we can start looking for the cause. Maybe we are not sleeping enough. Maybe we need to get a book on css. Maybe asking the iOS developer for help can overcome the change. Yet before we can act on the deficiencies, we need to identify and acknowledge them.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We find a similar dynamic as a group, in our teams. Even if we have team members that can handle reality, the team as a whole may not be able to do so. This is where safety and power comes into play. Those in power must make it safe to have team members bring up reality and act on suggestions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's say that a deadline was missed. The team knows it was missed because the schedule was overly optimistic. If members don't feel safe to point it out because they can be punished for doing so, they won't. People will become yes men out of necessity. Leadership will increasingly find themselves in a parallel reality where their beliefs are reality -- until reality reassesses itself, often in painful ways. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe the team can be mature enough to acknowledge reality, but they lack power to make changes. If a schedule is too optimistic, you need to add more slack to it. But the team manager may not have the power to do that. Or it was identified that the team needs training in a new technology executives decided to adopt. But they won't give them the budget. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Retrospectives then become a ritual that teaches learned helplessness. People will become jaded. They will resent the ritual because it is meaningless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In reality most of us work in places where the conditions are not ideal. What to do? As individuals we can practice self-reflection ourselves, and act within our power. If it is safe, we can model this with coworkers. This is what each of us can do to foster a culture of self-reflection and safety.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are a manager you have greater power to shape culture. There are two things that are important to create this culture. The first one is to honestly model self-reflection. The stress is on the honesty. The second one is to act on suggestions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you were responsible for the optimistic schedule, you can acknowledge that, and adjust it. Say something like, "I forgot to include slack for people getting sick" or "I didn't take into consideration the mandatory corporate retreat". Then you need to follow through fixing the schedule.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's say that in a retrospective workers say slack is too distracting, and they need 4 hours where they can turn it off so they can focus on work. The manager wants to make sure that people can still be reached within reasonable periods of time. The manager says that they can turn off slack for two hours, check messages and answer them then, and then turn it off for another two hours. The team most likely be pleased. It may not be 4 hours solid, but getting two focus segments are better than none.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We must keep in mind that power is often limited, so we can sometimes only do modest changes. Hopefully those changes can build up over time and we can then reap the benefits of self-reflection.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="log"></category><category term="software-engineering"></category></entry><entry><title>Goals over Process</title><link href="https://oskipa.github.io/goals-over-process.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2020-05-30T00:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2020-05-30T00:00:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Hugo Estrada</name></author><id>tag:oskipa.github.io,2020-05-30:/goals-over-process.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Sometimes when we learn a new methodology we become eager to implement it.

It is like buying a new board game and being eager to play it with others.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In our zeal to implement these methodologies, we may lose track that a methodology is a means to achieve a goal. The discipline is not the goal itself. Yet it is so easy to fall into the trap of making the discipline the goals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is the goal of methodologies like agile or waterfall? It is to give some organization to software development. Ideally to create working habits that give managers the information they need while giving workers predictable working environment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultimately what managers need is to know what is the state of a project in terms of completion and schedule. This is necessary to make decisions to keep a project on schedule. To a lesser extent they need to know how their workers are performing. This is necessary to identify problems and provide training if possible. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Workers need a reasonable work process. They need to have the necessary autonomy, training, and tools. They need a safe environment so that they can focus on their work rather than office politics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keeping in mind these goals, we can adapt methodology principles to actual workplaces when we join them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If a team shares their daily tasks on a slack channel, that fulfills the information needs for the  manager. There isn't a need to introduce a stand up meeting. You may love the stand up ritual, but if you force on people who don't want to do it, they will resent you for wasting their time. At the end of the day the manager is still getting the information they need.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Process is a tool. If some behavior exists that already fulfill the goal, then the pragmatic decision is to keep that behavior.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="log"></category><category term="process"></category></entry><entry><title>Find and Replace Recursively</title><link href="https://oskipa.github.io/find-and-replace-recursively.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2020-05-27T00:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2020-05-27T00:00:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Hugo Estrada</name></author><id>tag:oskipa.github.io,2020-05-27:/find-and-replace-recursively.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;grep -rl &amp;quot;Chunky&amp;quot; . | LC_ALL=C xargs sed -i &amp;quot;.bak&amp;quot;  &amp;quot;s/Chunky/Bacon/&amp;quot;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every so often we need to mass edit some directories. That should be the job of sed. Yet sed doesn't find files, so you need another utility. There you have a choice of tools. For this case I decided to use grep. Although I use ack for searching patterns, I thought that grep would be the right tool here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now the explanation of the example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Magical bit&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Explanation&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;grep&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Our second favorite tool for finding patterns in files. Our favorite is ack, but grep is more appropriate here.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;-rl&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Our grep options. r = recursive search. l = output the name of the files&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;"Chunky"&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Our pattern&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;The direction we want to search. In this case, start from the current directory&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;the pipe&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;The magic unix character that lets us pass output into another command&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;LC_ALL=C&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;The esoteric incantation to have sed behave in MacOS. It has to do with encoding&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;xargs&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Unix utility to transform standard input into command arguments&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;sed&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Our batch editor&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;-i&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;The option to edit in place&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;".bak"&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;The extension that we want to give to the backup file that sed -i will create&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;"s/Chunky/Bacon/"&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;The sed command we want to execute. In this case substitute Chunky with Bacon&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can clean up the backup files with &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;grep -rl &amp;quot;Chunky&amp;quot; . | xarg rm -f

You cannot learn just by watching a lecture. It is a skill that one must cultivate via doing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the question is, how much should you spend on a problem that you cannot solve?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One school of thought is that you keep at that problem until you can solve it by yourself. It seems to make sense. If you put enough effort, you will discover the solution. Or find a novel one. Unfortunately you may not find a solution, so you can stop playing chess or learning math if you strikingly stick to this method.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A better method is to timebox how much time you spend on solving a puzzle. The rule of thumb is that you should find the basic solution within five minutes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For those five minutes, you will attempt to solve the problem all by yourself. You have to give it your all. If you solved it, good! Pat yourself in the back!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you don't, you look at the answer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If this cheating? No. Problem solving is about pattern recognition. If you couldn't find a solution, you couldn't find a pattern. That means you haven't learned that pattern.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By spending those earnest five minutes trying to solve the problem, you will understand the problem well. You will understand why your natural solution didn't work. When you look at the solution, it is meaningful. Your emotional reaction to seeing the solution will make it easier for you to remember it, creating that desire pattern for you to recognize the next time you see a similar problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also learned this tactic by looking at the solution. I found this strategy in a chess book, which in turn adopted it from what seems to be a math teaching tactic in Russia.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="log"></category><category term="learning"></category><category term="comp sci"></category><category term="math"></category></entry><entry><title>Looping in Ruby</title><link href="https://oskipa.github.io/looping-in-ruby.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2020-04-22T00:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2020-04-22T00:00:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Hugo Estrada</name></author><id>tag:oskipa.github.io,2020-04-22:/looping-in-ruby.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Looping in Ruby is usually a delight.  &lt;!-- break --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For 90% of your looping needs, #each, or an Enumerable, #map, #select, #any?, #all?, etc, will do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are working with a queue or a stack, you can always use the classic where loop&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;where&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;stack&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span class="nv"&gt;empty&lt;/span&gt;?
&lt;span class="w"&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;ghost&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;stack&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span class="nv"&gt;pop&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;pacman&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span class="nv"&gt;chomp&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ss"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;ghost&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ss"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet every so often you will get to some problem where a classic for loop would be perfect. This is where it becomes awkward. Ruby doesn't have a classic for loop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a for loop. But it is not C style for loop. Instead it loops over a collection. Usually a list or a range.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is how it works. This will go by each element.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;in&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;list&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;do&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;puts&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In effect, it is a wordy version of #each. Therefore most people use #each.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But we want a C style for! Because sometimes using indices is the right solution to a problem. Even though we don't have something just like it, we can build something close to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's say you want something like this from C#&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;var&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;list&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;Count&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;++&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;      &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;WriteLn&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;list&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;ToString&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;());&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can replicate it by doing something like this&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ow"&gt;in&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mf"&gt;0.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;..&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;list&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;length&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;do&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;     &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;puts&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;list&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here we are using a range. So we will cycle through 0 to list.length - 1. We get that -1 automatically by using the ... range operator that says that we don't want to include the last number. If you wanted to include the last number, we would have written (0..list.length), but this would throw and out of range error when it got to the last item.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what do you do when you want to go backwards? We can come up with something as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ow"&gt;in&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mf"&gt;0.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;..&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;list&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;length&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;to_a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;reverse&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;do&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;puts&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;list&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here we start with the range. We turn it into an array, and then we call reverse. Wordy? Yes. Does it get the job done? Also yes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The good news is that these are rare scenarios.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="log"></category><category term="ruby"></category></entry><entry><title>Getting Started With Byebug</title><link href="https://oskipa.github.io/intro-byebug.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2020-04-21T00:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2020-04-21T00:00:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Hugo Estrada</name></author><id>tag:oskipa.github.io,2020-04-21:/intro-byebug.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;This is a very quick guide/checklist on how to install and get debugging with Byebug, a Ruby debugger.  &lt;!-- break --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To add the point where byebug will start the session in your …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;This is a very quick guide/checklist on how to install and get debugging with Byebug, a Ruby debugger.  &lt;!-- break --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or add to your Gemfile&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;gem byebug
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Setting a breakpoint and starting a session&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To add the point where byebug will start the session in your code, essentially, the breakpoint, you type the method "byebug" in your code. If your code looks like this,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;def my_awesome_function()
  process
  log
end
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You would set the breakpoint like this&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;def my_awesome_function()
  byebug
  process
  log
end
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are running your code directly, the process should stop when your code reaches the line with &lt;code&gt;byebug&lt;/code&gt;. If you are using something like foreman, then you have the option to connect to a sockets session on another terminal tab.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The debugger screen&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once byebug starts its session, you will see the debugger screen. This screen will give you the file name, and then some lines of the code. There will be a arrow showing you the current place where the code execution has stopped.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To step over the next line of code, enter "next".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To step into the next line of code, enter "step"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To step out, enter, "finish". This last one doesn't seem to work as I would want it to, so sometimes I have to enter it several times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If by querying values you can't see the code where you are stopped, you can get the listing back by typing "list =".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To let the program run, type "continue".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Navigating the Stack Trace&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To see the stack trace, type "backtrack". This should give you a pretty output of the stack trace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to go back in the stack trace so that you can query the environment at a previous point in the execution, type "up".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you are done doing your exploring, you can come back to later points by typing "down".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Querying current values&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps one of the most important things you can do in the debugging console is to query the value of different variables.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can examine variables by typing their name and hitting enter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;(byebug) name
&amp;quot;My name&amp;quot;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Trying out solutions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you think you found a way to solve your bug, you can try the solution directly in the console to see if it works out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Learning more&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The debugger becomes a better tool if your add to it an understanding on Ruby's object model and method dispatch. Having a good command on Ruby's reflection methods also helps.&lt;/p&gt;

Clarkson. It is used by Cornell University for their functional programming course.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I enjoyed reading chapter one. They explain the goals and purpose of the class that the book supports. It also has a great section on the history of the  book and the course. It tells how the class was originally based on &lt;a href="http://sarabander.github.io/sicp/html/index.xhtml#SEC_Contents"&gt;Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs&lt;/a&gt;, (SICP). From the challenges of teaching SICP, they changed languages, from Scheme to OCaml, and they developed the textbook from their class notes. This is fascinating because it is a similar experience that lead to the development of &lt;a href="https://racket-lang.org/"&gt;Racket&lt;/a&gt; and the supporting book &lt;a href="https://htdp.org/"&gt;How To Design Programs&lt;/a&gt;. I will probably talk more about how SICP, a beloved textbook, lead to the creation of other books in a future entry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chapter 2 is an introduction to OCaml as a language. I have read a number of tutorials and several chapters on other OCaml books, and "Functional Programming in Ocaml" seems to be one of the clearest explanations on the basics of OCaml. If for some reason you didn't understand the topic well enough from this text, at the end of the chapter the authors tell you which chapters from others OCaml books you should read to get an alternate explanation of the same topics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a caveat to the previous statement. It will be clear if you have a basic understanding on lambda calculus and you are familiar with how modern  mathematics defines concepts. If you are not familiar with these, the text should be more challenging. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The exercises for chapter 2 were good. You get to face the difference between integer operators such as +, -, * , /, versus the floating point operators, like +., -., * . / .. &lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="log"></category><category term="ocaml"></category><category term="notes"></category></entry><entry><title>Survival Ruby Reflection</title><link href="https://oskipa.github.io/survival-ruby-reflection.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2020-03-10T00:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2020-03-10T00:00:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Hugo Estrada</name></author><id>tag:oskipa.github.io,2020-03-10:/survival-ruby-reflection.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Ruby has a strong reflection system.

&lt;p&gt;This will give you a string representation of the object. Very useful when programming and debugging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;my_object.respond_to?(:method_name)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This one will tell you if the object can respond to a method. So Let's say that you want to call &lt;code&gt;batman.swing&lt;/code&gt;. But can you? You can query the object with &lt;code&gt;batman.respond_to?(:swing)&lt;/code&gt; and it will answer with true or false. Notice how you need to use the colon for the method name when sent as a parameter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;my_object.methods&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(my_object.methods - Object.new.methods).sort&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first one will list all the methods that the object can respond to. Depending on the object, the list can be large. Once you look through them, you will discover that many of the methods were not defined in the class itself.  The last version will remove all of the methods that are inherited by Object, the root parent object that most object descend from.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;my_object.method(:method_name).source_location&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is perhaps the most useful one when looking for code.

Do you feel confused because there are no 'require' statements and variables seem to mushroom out of nowhere? Does Rails seem too magical to you? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If this describes you, don't worry. I have gathered this quick list of pointers to help you find your bearing. Hopefully they will make Rails more logical and less magical.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Rails loads all objects found under the 'app' directory into the global scope&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is why you don't see 'require' statements. Most objects are available in the global scope.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why? Think of it as a radical kind of Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY). Whether you think this is a good idea doesn't matter. This is a Rails convention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The title statement may be a gross oversimplification. Yet it will be helpful if you assume this is true unless proven wrong. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Carefully read the error messages&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ruby errors are usually useful. They tell you what went wrong along with the location where the problem happened.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ruby's error stack trace will usually give you the file and line number where the failure has happened. This is key for solving problems. The stack trace will usually have a mix of code from our application and from Ruby libraries, commonly called gems. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Read them like this: starting from the top, scan line by line until you recognize a file from your application. Identify the file and line number, and start your debugging there. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Learn about Ruby's method dispatch and reflection&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ruby does what you expect until it doesn't. It will all seem magical and confusing unless you understand how method dispatch works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Method dispatch is Ruby's process of looking for a method definition to execute it. When you call 'batman.punch', method dispatch is trying to find where the '.punch' is. It start looking for a definition in the object's class, and then it goes up the object's ancestors. That is the basic idea.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The basic idea is also wrong. It is more complicated than that. Read this blog post to get an accurate picture: &lt;a href="https://blog.jcoglan.com/2013/05/08/how-ruby-method-dispatch-works/"&gt;How Ruby method dispatch works&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ruby has a strong reflection system. You can query a lot of information from an object. Using reflection methods is more useful if you understand how method dispatch works. But even if you don't, the following two methods will be useful right away.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;batman.inspect
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;'.inspect' gives you a string representation of the 'batman' object. Useful in the interactive ruby shell (irb), in the debugger, or  when printing to the log or a debugger via a 'puts object.inspect'.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;batman.methods
batman.methods.sort
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;'.methods' gives you an array of all of the methods that the 'batman' object can respond to.  If you add '.sort', then they will be sorted alphabetically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want more in depth information, read chapters 2 and 3 from the book &lt;a href="https://pragprog.com/book/ppmetr2/metaprogramming-ruby-2"&gt;Metaprogramming Ruby 2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The docs: Ruby Doc, Rails Guides, The Rail Way, and the source code&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://ruby-doc.org/"&gt;Ruby Doc&lt;/a&gt; should help you if you have questions about the language. The documentation is well written and useful. Ruby is programmer friendly, so if want a method to do something to an array, it most likely exists. I often consult &lt;a href="https://ruby-doc.org/core-2.7.0/Array.html"&gt;Array&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://ruby-doc.org/core-2.7.0/Hash.html"&gt;Hash&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://ruby-doc.org/core-2.7.0/String.html"&gt;String&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://ruby-doc.org/core-2.7.0/Enumerable.html"&gt;Enumerable&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://guides.rubyonrails.org/"&gt;Rails Guides&lt;/a&gt; should be your first option to learn anything about Rails. For example, if you are learning about Active Record or how to make a configuration change, you should consult this site first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can't find what you are looking for?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://leanpub.com/tr5w"&gt;The Rails Way&lt;/a&gt; should be your next stop. Look for the correct Rails version for your application. It has clear and in-depth explanations on how the different parts of Rails work. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still mystified or confused?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Read &lt;a href="https://github.com/rails/rails"&gt;Rails' source code&lt;/a&gt;. It is recommended for you to look the source code up if all of the above have failed. Read it if you are curious on how something is put together. Read it if you need to check exactly when some feature was added or removed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Use a debugger&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ruby has two popular command line debuggers, Pry and Byebug. When you add their names into your code, it will open an interactive, command line  shell where you can inspect values, query the variables available in the global space, and do a lot more. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have learned about Ruby's method dispatch and Ruby's reflection methods, the debugger will help you understand how everything gets put together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The debugger is perhaps the best tool to understand Rails: use it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Identify which debugger your app is using. Learn how to use it, and learn some of its commands. If there isn't one installed, spend some time to get Byebug set up.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="log"></category><category term="ruby"></category><category term="rails"></category></entry><entry><title>Using Pelican</title><link href="https://oskipa.github.io/using-pelican.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2020-03-08T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2020-03-08T00:00:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Hugo Estrada</name></author><id>tag:oskipa.github.io,2020-03-08:/using-pelican.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I am in the process of cleaning up the site so that I can start writing again.

I have decided that I will do two kinds of writing. One is very careful; I think of them as real articles. The second type are quick learning notes. My ideal site would have a section for those more well thought out pieces and one for the quicker, study notes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After looking for a while, I decided that Pelican should be able to make it easy for me to get these two things done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have found that I have enjoyed working with Pelican. It is easy to use and easy to customize. The documentation is superb. And if you run into something that is not covered, you can find the answer with a web search.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have enjoyed using the make command to build and publish the site. It seems to make things easier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, Pelican is easy to understand. After you have worked a bit, you find that most settings are python constants found in the settings page. There are few surprises, for which I am grateful.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="log"></category><category term="python"></category><category term="static site"></category></entry><entry><title>Django, first impressions</title><link href="https://oskipa.github.io/django-first-impressions.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2020-03-07T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2020-03-07T00:00:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Hugo Estrada</name></author><id>tag:oskipa.github.io,2020-03-07:/django-first-impressions.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I am working through the Django tutorial.

&lt;p&gt;Pluggable apps are such a great idea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The way to define fields seems pretty straight forward. Using a more object style versus a more ruby-like dsl seems to help because finding the documentation should be easier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is different from other frameworks. I like the idea of having a language module as the components.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="log"></category><category term="python"></category><category term="django"></category></entry><entry><title>A Friendly GUI Debugger for Ruby</title><link href="https://oskipa.github.io/ruby-gui-debugger.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2020-03-01T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2020-03-01T00:00:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Hugo Estrada</name></author><id>tag:oskipa.github.io,2020-03-01:/ruby-gui-debugger.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I have been learning Smalltalk.

And Smalltalk have these great programming tools. I am particularly impressed by the object browser and its debugger. Smalltalk was designed so that the system would be learnable. If you wondered how something worked, you could inspect the object and see how it was put together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pry, byebug, irb, and the rails console  are a command line version of the Smalltalk debugger and object browser. Yet it requires some level of training to use it. You have to learn debugging Ruby objects to better inspect your work. You need to learn byebug commands. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although I understand that many experienced rubyists may find the command line interface for the debuggers better, a GUI front for byebug would be a great help for beginners. These beginners could be both people new to coding or experienced programmers new to Ruby, who are used to these kinds of tools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am hoping to have the time to create a simple prototype of what this GUI could look like, and then try it out. Who knows? Maybe I will agree with the rest of the community and decide that the command line interface is superior. &lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="log"></category><category term="ruby"></category><category term="metaprogramming"></category><category term="book"></category></entry></feed>
