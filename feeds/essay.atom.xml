You are the technical partner. You are bootstrapping. Your product will go against well funded competitors. You are counting on speed and innovation as your advantage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You are about to pick up a computer language. This is how you go do it. Current best practices say that you must pick a popular language so that it will be easy to hire developers. Although you are not super familiar with JavaScript, you pick it because it is popular. You pick Node for the backend, and React for the front-end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Was this a good decision? Was this decision reached the right way? Think about it for a moment before reading the rest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the wrong way of making the decision. And JavaScript is the wrong language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The key reason lies on the startup relying on innovation as part of their business advantage. &lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="essay"></category><category term="engineering"></category><category term="business"></category><category term="innovation"></category></entry><entry><title>Innovation in the US</title><link href="https://oskipa.github.io/innovation-in-the-us.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2023-05-02T00:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2023-05-02T00:00:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Hugo Estrada</name></author><id>tag:oskipa.github.io,2023-05-02:/innovation-in-the-us.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;One of the most attractive, powerful, and hard to imitate attributes of the United States is its culture of innovation.

The United States generates a lot of new ideas, inventions, and new processes. Innovation appears in all aspects of society: engineering, yes, but also education, political organizing, the arts, and even spirituality. Many countries create new religions, but I have a hard time of finding one where so many of them are successful and survive as long as the ones started in the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And while the U.S. has a strong culture of innovation, U.S. business doesn't. On the contrary, U.S. business has a culture of inertia, immitation, and mediocry. It resists innovation. It is fashion driven: people keep track of what is popular, and then they adopt it so that they can be part of the cool kids' clique.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of you may be shaking their heads in disbelief. We in the U.S. have heard the narrative about how competition and business leadership leads to innovation. This has been said for more than a century. But instead of listening to what U.S. businesses says, let's pay attention to what we do. Let's review how U.S. innovators create and what business leaders do with these creations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. nurtures innovation in a number of ways. It has as a cultural hero the wacky inventor. It tolerates eccentrism if there are results. Tinkering is encouraged, especially if one can create a new tool or improve an exsiting one. Scientific American started as a magazine that shared new inventions. It was consumed for entertainment. Figures like Thomas Edison, Nicola Tesla, Alexander Graham Bell are cultural heroes to this day. This is remarkable for a country that is focused on the present and future, often ignoring its own past, good or bad. Benjamin Franklin was heavily involved in the creation of the U.S. as a nation, yet he is often most remembered for his inventions and scientific experiments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. also has a history of embracing technology to see what we can do with it. We are familiar with our recent history of people adopting cell phones, personal computers, and the internet. Yet this goes back a lot longer. The US still have a community of ham radio enthusiasts, many who built their own radios. Do It Yourself has a market for itself, with big companies like Home Depot providing tools and materials for people to build on their own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And it is not only technology. We also have seen a lot of cultural innovation. The world consumes and emulates Hollywood-style movies. For generations, people around the world have learned to play jazz, rock, and hip hop. They read U.S. styled comic books, put on U.S. musicals, and go to U.S. styled standup comedy. There wouldn't be manga without U.S. comics. There would be Mexican Lucha Libre without U.S. professional wrestling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It goes beyond engineering and the arts. We have people like Gene Sharp, who is a renown strategic non-violence theorist. His strategies have been successful used to nonviolently take down dictatorship around the world. Murray Bookchin, a social theorist, outlined methods of direct democracy that have been put in place in Kurdistan and Catalunya. Demmings created a process of creating high quality, which is largely credited with bringing Japan from postwar destruction to becoming a leading economic power. You probably haven't heard of these people. They are better known outside the United States.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some would dismiss the appeal of U.S. culture as a product of propaganda and cultural imperialism. And there is some element of truth in that. The U.S. did spend a lot of money during the Cold War to make sure that people around the world would learn about U.S. culture through the Reader's Digest, Disney movies on the one hand, and abstract expressionists and avant-garde music on the other. But even acknowledging that, the consumption and adoption wouldn't have worked if it wasn't appealing. U.S. culture has a lot of that is attractive to people around the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take hip hop, for example. Hip hop is perhaps the most successfully adopted music genre. You can find people doing French hip hop, Loatian hip hop, indigineous Bolivian hip hop. Unlike rock music, there aren't big record companies sponsoring it. Hip hop starts spreading to the rest of the world when the Cold War propaganda money ends. Yet the simplicity of the genre, the encouragement to speak up; it has people independently making loops and rapping over them about love, injustice, existential angst, humor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In short, the U.S. has a long history of nurturing, encouraging, and celebrating all kinds of innovations.This is part of U.S. culture. If we can talk about a national character, tinkering, improving, creating new tools to make life easier, creating new art forms to express ourselves, is part of the U.S. character.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;U.S. Business Distrusts Innovation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is surprising, then, when we find that historically, U.S. business dislikes innovation. At best, it doesn't know what to do with it. At worst, it will use its power and influence to destroy it. Business disturst innovation because it can be an existential threat. To make matters worse, it is unclear what innovation is actually a threat; we only know which ones were significant after the fact. So, although the vast majority of innovations die on the vine, every single one of them can be seen as an existential threat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It makes sense that Business is against innovation, especially leading companies in a market. Let's look at big oil. Exxon, BP, and Royal Dutch Shell control the supply of oil in the US. They provide the energy fuel that transport us, creates our electricity, and runs many of our industrial machines. This control gives them a lot of money, and with that money, power. Not abstract power, but real, power. Big oil can dictate national foreign policy, including which countries the U.S. should invade. In fact, they have enjoyed this power for over 100 years. Alternative energy sources are a threat, which they historically have been successful at eliminating, or, when that wasn't possible, restricting. It is then more outrageous if some employees at Exxon create a practical, decentralized alternative energy. This hypothentical innovation could, at best, diminish their money and power, and at worst, destroy the company and the oil industry as we know. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's leave hypotheticals and review history. Let's review the famous Kodak case. Kodak was a world leader in the photograph market. They sold cameras, photographic paper, photographic chemicals, but most importantly, rolls of film. This was the source of their profits. If families wanted to preserve memories, most people, at some point paid them money for that service, first for the film, and then for the development. Kodak engineers in the 90s create the electronic camera, one that didn't create films. Kodak famously buried this project, business leaders probably unhappy that they had spent money on a product that would kill their profits. Other companies entered into that market, and today Kodak is mostly a memory among older people. We have adults today who don't really know about this company at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although for lay people these can be exiting stories of how business are born, grow, and die, if you are running a company, these are existential threats. A CEO understands why Kodak would prevent the electronic camera to be sold. They probably would do the same or have done so. This is your main fear: someone, somwhere, will create a product or service that can destroy your company.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Business propaganda, then, claims that business and capitalism drives innovation. Markets are this open competition where anyone with a good idea can start a company and disrupt existing markets. Look at iWgit, the ubiquitous successful company. The founder had a great idea, which was rejected by many people. So he and his best buddy started working in a garage and started the iWidgets revolution, disrupting the Big Widget market. Remember Widgetron? Yeah, iWidgit took them down. Here is beautiful version of it. In 1984 Apple famously created the 1984 ad for the McIntosh computer. Big brother is on a big screen, watched by gray drones in rows. A young atheltic woman runs and throws a hammer at the screen, smashing it into pieces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can quickly notice how there is a strange use of revolutionary language. We have a great vision, a distrustful establishment, a small guerrilla that pushes forward, armed with a great innovation. They succeeed, disrupting the existing order, making the world a better place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Frankly, if one is bootstrapping a company, this narrative is inspiring and attractive. It may be necessary to be able to push forward when the odds are against you. But does it make sense to see the CEO of Meta talk like this? Microsoft? Uber, with an investor fund that is much greater than municipal taxi companies? The leading companies in an economic sector are the establishment. Why would they want to embrace a narrative than can bring them down?  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. business embraces the language and narrative of innovation, and revolution, because it fears it. Big business can control markets, regulatory agencies, lawmakers, and judges. It can't control innovation, because the U.S. citizens can't stop innovatating. It is too grassroots. It happens everywhere. You see it universities; you find it in garages; in community workshops; even worse, in U.S. corporations, right under their noses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zeus becomes the ruler of Gods when he kills his father, Uranus. And then Zeus actively searches for the God destined to kill him and replace him. He learns from Prometheus that the son of Tethis is fated to be that God. So Zeus arranges for Tethis to marry a mortal, giving birth to Achilles, a mortal, thus avoiding the cycle of the child of a God destroying the current ruler. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Exploiting the Opportunity&lt;/h2&gt;</content><category term="essay"></category><category term="engineering"></category><category term="business"></category><category term="innovation"></category></entry><entry><title>The myth of fear of change</title><link href="https://oskipa.github.io/the-myth-of-fear-of-change.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2023-05-02T00:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2023-05-02T00:00:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Hugo Estrada</name></author><id>tag:oskipa.github.io,2023-05-02:/the-myth-of-fear-of-change.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;What happens when you suggest changing how work is done, let's say, adopting waterscrum, the hot new process that adopts the best of waterfall with the best of scrum, and your employees start pushing back?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You could listen to your employees. After all, they are the people doing the work. They understand how your company actually works. Many of them have years of experience. Many have tried waterfall and scrum. Many may be fine with the suggestion, but are objectiving to specific implementation details. You could listen to this and consider it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or you can dismiss the feedback as people having "fear of change". And go forward with your decision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I haven't found a group of people ever being afraid of change when the innovation is good. I can't recall someone fighting back Skype when they pitched unlimitted calls for three dollars a month. Or when Netflix offered DVD rentals with no late fees. How about people rejecting GUI computing with the Mac and Windows? Or IT engineers rejecting AWS EC2, allowing you to run a server in about two to five minutes?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No, as a population, people didn't reject these innovations. They were embraced. Because all of these improved our lives. If an innovation is good, people with adopt and embrace it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You may think about some people sticking to some older technology as examples of "fear of change." Your aunt still uses her landline phone. But not so much because she rejects her cell phone, but because she is hard of hearing and the line quality sounds better for her. And all of her friends reach her at that phone number. And she plays candycrush on her iPhone and shares minion memes in Facebook. She sticks to some older technology for specific tasks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The same can be said about consolve vs gui computing. A lot of people use a terminal, a technology created in the 1970s. And this is not rejecting windowed computing. There are some tasks that work better in the terminal, so you reach for the terminal to do them. The vast majority of people access their terminal via a GUI machine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what are people resistant to, then? They are resistant to getting hurt. And to a lesser extent, they are resistant to wasting time on bad ideas, many already proven as failures. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many people were resistant to highway projects running through cities in the 1950s and 1960s. Did they hate progress? Did they fear change? No, they wanted to keep their homes and neighboorhoods. They didn't want to get hurt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How about giving up banking and financial regulations in the 1980s and 1990s? Were the people opposed to rolling back the laws that gave financial stability to the US for 50 years fearful of innovation? No, they were afraid that doing so would bring back the boom and bust cycles that hurt generations of US citizens before these laws were put in place. They didn't want to get hurt. Judging by the 10 to 15 years cycles of "once in a lifetime" recessions that we have experienced and expect since they wrote those laws off the books, the people against these changes were right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, you may say, how about the famous Kodak case, where they invented the electronic camera, but the leadership was resistant to change? This is a real example of how fear to change tanked Kodak? Here we have two things going on. Their reluctancy did come from the fear of getting hurt. Most of the profits from Kodak came from selling film. The business leadership was correct in identifying that pushing for electronic cameras was going to kill their film division. With Kodak, it wasn't the fear of change that tanked them. It was a bad business decision, driven in part because there wasn't a good solution to their problem. Embracing electronic cameras may have kept them going a little longer, but I haven't bought a camera in years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our intelligence depends on other people being allowed to tell us that we are wrong. If the people we work with are strongly opposed to some initiative that we have, it is best to listen carefully. They may be saving us from a terrible decision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Assuming good faith, what if you think that your idea is still good, but the opposition comes from it being unconventional? Then prove it at a small scale, to reduce the risk. Get a team to adopt the new process. Prove interest in your new product by collecting emails of people who want to use it. Build some prototypes and have people try your product out. In the US, people will quickly adopt tools or practices if they are successful with other US teams or companies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And what if others don't adopt them? Then you have a competitive advantage. Use it.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="essay"></category><category term="propaganda"></category></entry></feed>
