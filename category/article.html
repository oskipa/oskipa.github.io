   <h2><a href="/the-meta-story-of-modern-software-development.html">The meta story of modern software development</a></h2>
   <label>17 October, 2022</label>
   <p>tl/dr: Writing software is facing our ignorance and faillability. Our practices mean that we don't know what to do, and when we do, we don't trust ourselves</p>
<p>Stories are the main way in which we communicate with each other. We want stories. We want them history, yes, but we also want...
   <h2><a href="/social-tech.html">The social context of technology work</a></h2>
   <label>02 March, 2022</label>
   <p>Software has a tech bias. Our culture emphasizes technology while ignoring social dynamics. We choose to lose ourselves in technological details. This gives us the option to ignore the social dynamics. Some of us do it more than others. Our current culture pushes us in that...

   <p>A coworker from sales asks you if you can help her manage her list of potential clients.</p>
<p>You could start by designing a new kubernetes pod that includes Postgres as the database, Redis for caching, RabbitMQ for the queuing system. One container will run Node.js to serve the React user...

   <label>08 January, 2022</label>
   <p>I have been interested in Design By Contract. I don't have access to Eiffel. I want to try them out in Ruby. I looked into the frameworks provided by Ruby, but I don't fully understand how it works. I read that they have a lot of limitation. Frameworks are in fact little languages that one...
   <h2><a href="/the-missing-tech-context.html">The Missing Tech Context</a></h2>
   <label>21 November, 2021</label>
   <p>Recently I ran into a discussion on a Ruby forum about the "right" way to implement a <code>.double</code> function. One solution used a <code>case</code> block that checked on the object's type. The other one added <code>.double</code> methods to the <code>Numeric</code>, <code>Array</code>,...
   <h2><a href="/power-makes-you-stupid.html">Power makes you stupid</a></h2>
   <label>06 June, 2020</label>
   <p>We all have heard how power corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutely. Probably more worrisome is that power stupefies and absolute power stupefies absolutely.</p>
<p>Although we have been taught that intelligence is an individual trait, it is to a large extend a communal one. Humans...

   <label>03 June, 2020</label>
   <p>Frameworks should make your work easier. Yes, there will be moments when you will have to fight with the framework to get something done. These cases should be rare. In general, you should not think about a framework or be happy when using it. </p>
<p>Ideally a framework lets you get your...
   <h2><a href="/listen-instead-of-getting-buy-in.html">Listen instead of getting buy in</a></h2>
   <label>06 May, 2020</label>
   <p>I learned recently that product owners and managers are trained to seek team members to buy-in into new process, goals, or plans. This was an unfortunate word selection. It undermines building trust in a team. It frames the relationship between managers and workers the wrong...

   <label>05 May, 2020</label>
   <p>This is a small template that teaches you how to write a function. This template distills a number of great practices into a brief checklist. This short checklist, which is the core teaching of <a href="https://htdp.org/">How To Design Programs</a> book, concentrates writing code,...
