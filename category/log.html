   <label>31 July, 2020</label>
   <h3>tldr</h3>
<p><a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/doctest.html">doctest</a> [1]  is a library that allows you to write python examples in comments or text documents. This is handy because you can write examples, test them, and have the peace of mind that they work. </p>
<p>Here are...
   <h2><a href="/pythons-yield.html">Python's yield</a></h2>
   <label>30 July, 2020</label>
   <h2>The short answer</h2>
<p>Python's 'yield' is used instead of 'result' when you are creating results via a generator function. Think of generators as some sort of a lazy, stateful function that returns one item at a time. Why would we want that? We would want this when consuming a huge amount...
   <h2><a href="/pythons-with.html">Python's with</a></h2>
   <label>28 July, 2020</label>
   <h3>The point</h3>
<p>The "with" statement can be thought as syntactical sugar that replaces a try: except: finally: block with a cleaner syntax.</p>
<p>Let's focus on the practical application of with. This is an example taken from the PEP. You will see how clear the code is. What you see is...
   <h2><a href="/on-misspelling.html">On Misspelling</a></h2>
   <label>22 July, 2020</label>
   <p>English is notorious for how hard it is to spell its words. It is perhaps one of the biggest hurdles that people learning English have to go through, after learning how to make the many English sounds. Yet language learners and native speakers can both share in the frustration of its spelling...
   <h2><a href="/slow-writing.html">Slow writing</a></h2>
   <label>20 July, 2020</label>
   <p>In the last year I have found it hard to write. It feels that it is hard to express what I am thinking in sentences. When I do write, I notice weaknesses in my logic; in my construction of sentences; in the grammar of the sentences; and a lot of misspellings.</p>
<p>I have thought a lot about...
   <h2><a href="/pyenv-starter-pack.html">pyenv starter pack</a></h2>
   <label>17 July, 2020</label>
   <p>In my transition from Ruby to Python, I quickly found that there was a familiar experience that made me feel like I never left the Ruby: libraries won't work well in certain language versions.</p>
<p>The common solution for this problem is to find a version manager. For personal projects I...
   <h2><a href="/agile-self-reflection.html">Why don't we practice self-reflection in Agile?</a></h2>
   <label>01 June, 2020</label>
   <p>Self-reflection is my favorite part from agile. Call it a retrospective or a post-mortem; at the end of the day it is self-reflection. This is the self-correcting mechanism. You see what you have done. If it is not working, you do something else. If it perhaps the essence of agile. You can...
   <h2><a href="/goals-over-process.html">Goals over Process</a></h2>
   <label>30 May, 2020</label>
   <p>Sometimes when we learn a new methodology we become eager to implement it. It is like buying a new board game and being eager to play it with others.  </p>
<p>In our zeal to implement these methodologies, we may lose track that a methodology is a means to achieve a goal. The discipline is not...

   <label>24 April, 2020</label>
   <p>In fields like chess, math, and computer science, you need to do the problem to learn. You cannot learn just by watching a lecture. It is a skill that one must cultivate via doing.</p>
<p>But the question is, how much should you spend on a problem that you cannot solve?</p>

   <p>Are you an experienced developer? Have you been tasked to help out in a Rails project? Do you feel confused because there are no 'require' statements and variables seem to mushroom out of nowhere? Does Rails seem too magical to you? </p>
<p>If this describes you, don't worry. I have gathered...

   <p>I am in the process of cleaning up the site so that I can start writing again. I have decided that I do two kinds of writing. One is very careful; it is essentially writing what should be real articles. The second type are quick learning notes. My ideal site would have a section for those...

   <p>I am working through the Django tutorial. Here are some thoughts.</p>
<p>There really isn't any controllers. Interesting.</p>
<p>The instant admin area is amazing. </p>
<p>Pluggable apps is such a great idea.</p>
<p>The way to define fields seems pretty straight forward. Using a more object...

   <p>I have been learning Smalltalk. Smalltalk is very similar to Ruby. And Smalltalk have these great programming tools. I am particularly impressed by the object browser and it debugger. Smalltalk was designed so that the system would be learnable. If you wondered how something worked, you could...
