   <p>Renting software is considered the correct solution when we face the build vs rent question. There is an army of sales and marketing teams pushing the narrative that renting is going to be cheaper and better, allowing you to focus on your core busiess.

   <label>16 November, 2023</label>
   <p>When I started programming, a lot of the experienced developers would encourage people to use vim or emacs. Some were so enthusiastic that they made it into a badge for being a real developer. </p>

   <h2>The Long Story</h2>
<p>Vim and Emacs are old text editors, both created in the 1970s, about 50 years ago. Both of them have a steep learning curve. In both cases, the effort is worth it. You will learn new ways of working with text, code, and editors. You will learn tools that are free,...

   <p>We in the software developer world believe that a programming language, let's say, Python, is a single language, which will look the same everywhere. Python in particular encourages this idea with their, "there is only one way to do it" philosophy. Yet as people hop from company to company,...

   <label>30 July, 2020</label>
   <h2>The short answer</h2>
<p>Python's 'yield' is used instead of 'result' when you are creating results via a generator function. Think of generators as some sort of a lazy, stateful function that returns one item at a time. Why would we want that? We would want this when consuming a huge amount...
