  <h2>Slow writing</h2>
  <h3>Improving your writing by doing it slowly</h3>
  <label>20 July, 2020</label>
  <p>In the last year I have found it hard to write. It feels that it is hard to express what I am thinking in sentences. When I do write, I notice weaknesses in my logic; in my construction of sentences; in the grammar of the sentences; and a lot of misspellings.</p>
<p>I have thought a lot about this. I mainly attribute it to what I call "the writing haze." When I write, I find myself in this hazy state where I can't see grammatical mistakes or typos. I can start seeing them about 30 to 60 minutes after, once the haze goes away.</p>
<p>I thought the solution was to revise the next day. Yet while revising I sometimes found the first draft so lacking that I would try writing a new original draft. I ended up again in the writing haze; I, once again, couldn't see errors.</p>
<p>This morning I was thinking about it. I linked the writing haze with quick, scan reading, which also leads me to have a hazy mind which I can call "the reading haze." That reading haze so uncomfortable that about five years ago I decided to read deliberately slow. It has yielded great results. My reading retention has improved. Reading literature has once again become a vivid experience. Reading a chapter at a time lets me think about what I read, allowing me to chew on ideas.</p>
<p>I decided to do the writing equivalent of slow reading: slow writing. Maybe if I write slowly I will avoid entering in the writing haze, the same way reading slowly prevents one from entering in the reading haze. Maybe slow writing will encourage deliberate thinking. I am hoping that will be the case.</p>
<p>I will report how well it worked some time in the future.</p>
