  <h2>The failure of Gaminifaction -- Summary</h2>
  <h3>A summary to the longer piece on Gamification</h3>
  <label>20 July, 2025</label>
  <p>Gamification failed in the 2010s. This is my summary of a series of posts that I shared in Mastodon.</p>
<p>It failed because games are fun when they are not part of our duties. Adding badges and XP points to our chores won't fool anyone. So we feel manipulated, which leads to resentfulness.</p>
<p>My current position is that gamification of work, habits, and learning is disrespectful towards users. We shouldn't pretend that compulsory work is a game.</p>
<p>And before anyone thinks that this shows how my wise cynicism was right all along, I was firmly into the gamification camp. I honestly believed that it could work. Evidence shows that it won't.  Not only the experiences from the 2010s but also those from the 60s.</p>
<p>As for educational games, the best ones are good games first and foremost. The educational part is a side effect of the story telling supporting the game. </p>
<p>The Oregon Trail and Pirates! Would still be great games if you changed the stories into a post apocalyptic trip and Care Bears traveling from cloud to cloud exchanging love and empathy</p>
