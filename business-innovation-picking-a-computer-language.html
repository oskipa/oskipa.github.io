  <h2>Business Innovation: Picking a computer language</h2>
  <h3>Using picking a computer language as an example of what is and isn't innovation</h3>
  <label>02 May, 2023</label>
  <p>You are starting a small, two-person company. You are the technical partner. You are bootstrapping. Your product will go against well funded competitors. You are counting on speed and innovation as your advantage.</p>
<p>You are about to pick up a computer language. This is how you go do it. Current best practices say that you must pick a popular language so that it will be easy to hire developers. Although you are not super familiar with JavaScript, you pick it because it is popular. You pick Node for the backend, and React for the front-end.</p>
<p>Was this a good decision? Was this decision reached the right way? Think about it for a moment before reading the rest.</p>
<p>This is the wrong way of making the decision. And JavaScript is the wrong language.</p>
<p>The key reason lies on the startup relying on innovation as part of their business advantage. </p>
