   <label>24 April, 2020</label>
   <p>In fields like chess, math, and computer science, you need to do the problem to learn. You cannot learn just by watching a lecture. It is a skill that one must cultivate via doing.</p>
<p>But the question is, how much should you spend on a problem that you cannot solve?</p>
