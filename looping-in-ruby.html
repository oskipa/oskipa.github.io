  <h2>Looping in Ruby</h2>
  <h3>How to get a for loop in Ruby</h3>
  <label>22 April, 2020</label>
  <p>Looping in Ruby is usually a delight. The idiomatic way of doing it is via #each on </p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>animals.each do |beast|
  beast.roar
end
</pre></div>


<p>Sometimes you need the index. So you call in #each_with_index</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>animals.each_with_index do |beast, index|
  puts &quot;#{beast} #{index} says: #{beast.roar} &quot;
end
</pre></div>


<p>If you feel functional, then you can use one of the Enumerable objects</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>animals.map do |beast|
  beast.roar
end
</pre></div>


<p>For 90% of your looping needs, #each, or an Enumerable, #map, #select, #any?, #all?, etc, will do.</p>
<p>If you are working with a queue or a stack, you can always usse the classic where loop</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>where !stack.empty?
  ghost = stack.pop
  pacman.chomp(ghost)
end
</pre></div>


<p>Yet every so often you will get to some problem where a classic for loop would be perfect. This is where it becomes awkward. Ruby doesn't have a classic for loop.</p>
<p>There is a for loop. But it is not C style for loop. Instead it loops over an collection. Usually a list or a range.</p>
<p>This is how it works. This will go by each element.</p>
<p>for i in list do
    puts i
  end</p>
<p>In effect it is a wordy version of #each. Therefore most people use #each.</p>
<p>But we want a C style for! Because sometimes using indices is the right solution to a problem. Even though we don't have something just like it, we can build something close to it.</p>
<p>Let's say you want something like this from C#</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>  for (var i = 0; i &lt; list.Count; i++){
      console.WriteLn(list[i].ToString());
  }
</pre></div>


<p>You can replicate it by doing something like this</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>  for i in (0...list.length) do 
     puts list[i]
  end
</pre></div>


<p>Here we are using a range. So we will cycle through 0 to list.length - 1. We get that -1 automatically by using the ... range operator that says that we don't want to include the last number. If you wanted to do that, we would have written (0..list.length), but this would throw and out of range error when it got to the last item.</p>
<p>But what do you do when you want to go backwards? We can come up with something as well.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>for i in (0...list.length).to_a.reverse do
  puts list[i]
end
</pre></div>


<p>Here we start with the range. We turn it into an array, and then we call reverse. Wordy? Yes. Does it get the job done? Also yes. </p>
<p>The good news is that these are rare scenarios.</p>
