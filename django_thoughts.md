I am working through the Django tutorial. Here are some thoughts.

There really isn't any controllers. Interesting.

The instant admin area is amazing. 

Pluggable apps is such a great idea.

The way to define fields seems pretty straight forward. Using a more object style versus a more ruby-like dsl seems to help because finding the documentation should be easier.

This is different from other frameworks. I like the idea of having a language module as the components.
