  <h2>Goals over Process</h2>
  <h3>Process is a tool to achieve our goals. Avoid turning the process into the goal itself</h3>
  <label>30 May, 2020</label>
  <p>Sometimes when we learn a new methodology we become eager to implement it. It is like buying a new board game and being eager to play it with others.  </p>
<p>In our zeal to implement these methodologies, we may lose track that a methodology is a means to achieve a goal. The discipline is not the goal itself. Yet it is so easy to fall into the trap of making the discipline the goals.</p>
<p>What is the goal of methodologies like agile or waterfall? It is to give some organization to software development. Ideally to create working habits that give managers the information they need while giving workers predictable working environment. </p>
<p>Ultimately what managers need is to know what is the state of a project in terms of completion and schedule. This is necessary to make decisions to keep a project on schedule. To a lesser extent they need to know how their workers are performing. This is necessary to identify problems and provide training if possible. </p>
<p>Workers need a reasonable work process. They need to have the necessary autonomy, training, and tools. They need a safe environment so that they can focus on their work rather than office politics.</p>
<p>Keeping in mind these goals, we can adapt methodology principles to actual workplaces when we join them. </p>
<p>If a team shares their daily tasks on a slack channel, that fulfills the information needs for the  manager. There isn't a need to introduce a stand up meeting. You may love the stand up ritual, but if you force on people who don't want to do it, they will resent you for wasting their time. At the end of the day the manager is still getting the information they need.</p>
<p>Process is a tool. If some behavior exists that already fulfill the goal, then the pragmatic decision is to keep that behavior.</p>
