  <h2>Innovation in the US</h2>
  <h3>US innovation succeeds in spite of US business</h3>
  <label>02 May, 2023</label>
  <p>One of the most attractive, powerful, and hard to imitate attributes of the United States is its culture of innovation. The United States generates a lot of new ideas, inventions, and new processes. Innovation appears in all aspects of society: engineering, yes, but also education, political organizing, the arts, and even spirituality. Many countries create new religions, but I have a hard time of finding one where so many of them are successful and survive as long as the ones started in the U.S.</p>
<p>And while the U.S. has a strong culture of innovation, U.S. business doesn't. On the contrary, U.S. business has a culture of inertia, immitation, and mediocry. It resists innovation. It is fashion driven: people keep track of what is popular, and then they adopt it so that they can be part of the cool kids' clique.</p>
<p>Some of you may be shaking their heads in disbelief. We in the U.S. have heard the narrative about how competition and business leadership leads to innovation. This has been said for more than a century. But instead of listening to what U.S. businesses says, let's pay attention to what we do. Let's review how U.S. innovators create and what business leaders do with these creations.</p>
<p>The U.S. nurtures innovation in a number of ways. It has as a cultural hero the wacky inventor. It tolerates eccentrism if there are results. Tinkering is encouraged, especially if one can create a new tool or improve an exsiting one. Scientific American started as a magazine that shared new inventions. It was consumed for entertainment. Figures like Thomas Edison, Nicola Tesla, Alexander Graham Bell are cultural heroes to this day. This is remarkable for a country that is focused on the present and future, often ignoring its own past, good or bad. Benjamin Franklin was heavily involved in the creation of the U.S. as a nation, yet he is often most remembered for his inventions and scientific experiments.</p>
<p>The U.S. also has a history of embracing technology to see what we can do with it. We are familiar with our recent history of people adopting cell phones, personal computers, and the internet. Yet this goes back a lot longer. The US still have a community of ham radio enthusiasts, many who built their own radios. Do It Yourself has a market for itself, with big companies like Home Depot providing tools and materials for people to build on their own.</p>
<p>And it is not only technology. We also have seen a lot of cultural innovation. The world consumes and emulates Hollywood-style movies. For generations, people around the world have learned to play jazz, rock, and hip hop. They read U.S. styled comic books, put on U.S. musicals, and go to U.S. styled standup comedy. There wouldn't be manga without U.S. comics. There would be Mexican Lucha Libre without U.S. professional wrestling.</p>
<p>It goes beyond engineering and the arts. We have people like Gene Sharp, who is a renown strategic non-violence theorist. His strategies have been successful used to nonviolently take down dictatorship around the world. Murray Bookchin, a social theorist, outlined methods of direct democracy that have been put in place in Kurdistan and Catalunya. Demmings created a process of creating high quality, which is largely credited with bringing Japan from postwar destruction to becoming a leading economic power. You probably haven't heard of these people. They are better known outside the United States.</p>
<p>Some would dismiss the appeal of U.S. culture as a product of propaganda and cultural imperialism. And there is some element of truth in that. The U.S. did spend a lot of money during the Cold War to make sure that people around the world would learn about U.S. culture through the Reader's Digest, Disney movies on the one hand, and abstract expressionists and avant-garde music on the other. But even acknowledging that, the consumption and adoption wouldn't have worked if it wasn't appealing. U.S. culture has a lot of that is attractive to people around the world.</p>
<p>Take hip hop, for example. Hip hop is perhaps the most successfully adopted music genre. You can find people doing French hip hop, Loatian hip hop, indigineous Bolivian hip hop. Unlike rock music, there aren't big record companies sponsoring it. Hip hop starts spreading to the rest of the world when the Cold War propaganda money ends. Yet the simplicity of the genre, the encouragement to speak up; it has people independently making loops and rapping over them about love, injustice, existential angst, humor.</p>
<p>In short, the U.S. has a long history of nurturing, encouraging, and celebrating all kinds of innovations.This is part of U.S. culture. If we can talk about a national character, tinkering, improving, creating new tools to make life easier, creating new art forms to express ourselves, is part of the U.S. character.</p>
<h2>U.S. Business Distrusts Innovation</h2>
<p>It is surprising, then, when we find that historically, U.S. business dislikes innovation. At best, it doesn't know what to do with it. At worst, it will use its power and influence to destroy it. Business disturst innovation because it can be an existential threat. To make matters worse, it is unclear what innovation is actually a threat; we only know which ones were significant after the fact. So, although the vast majority of innovations die on the vine, every single one of them can be seen as an existential threat.</p>
<p>It makes sense that Business is against innovation, especially leading companies in a market. Let's look at big oil. Exxon, BP, and Royal Dutch Shell control the supply of oil in the US. They provide the energy fuel that transport us, creates our electricity, and runs many of our industrial machines. This control gives them a lot of money, and with that money, power. Not abstract power, but real, power. Big oil can dictate national foreign policy, including which countries the U.S. should invade. In fact, they have enjoyed this power for over 100 years. Alternative energy sources are a threat, which they historically have been successful at eliminating, or, when that wasn't possible, restricting. It is then more outrageous if some employees at Exxon create a practical, decentralized alternative energy. This hypothentical innovation could, at best, diminish their money and power, and at worst, destroy the company and the oil industry as we know. </p>
<p>Let's leave hypotheticals and review history. Let's review the famous Kodak case. Kodak was a world leader in the photograph market. They sold cameras, photographic paper, photographic chemicals, but most importantly, rolls of film. This was the source of their profits. If families wanted to preserve memories, most people, at some point paid them money for that service, first for the film, and then for the development. Kodak engineers in the 90s create the electronic camera, one that didn't create films. Kodak famously buried this project, business leaders probably unhappy that they had spent money on a product that would kill their profits. Other companies entered into that market, and today Kodak is mostly a memory among older people. We have adults today who don't really know about this company at all.</p>
<p>Although for lay people these can be exiting stories of how business are born, grow, and die, if you are running a company, these are existential threats. A CEO understands why Kodak would prevent the electronic camera to be sold. They probably would do the same or have done so. This is your main fear: someone, somwhere, will create a product or service that can destroy your company.  </p>
<p>Business propaganda, then, claims that business and capitalism drives innovation. Markets are this open competition where anyone with a good idea can start a company and disrupt existing markets. Look at iWgit, the ubiquitous successful company. The founder had a great idea, which was rejected by many people. So he and his best buddy started working in a garage and started the iWidgets revolution, disrupting the Big Widget market. Remember Widgetron? Yeah, iWidgit took them down. Here is beautiful version of it. In 1984 Apple famously created the 1984 ad for the McIntosh computer. Big brother is on a big screen, watched by gray drones in rows. A young atheltic woman runs and throws a hammer at the screen, smashing it into pieces.</p>
<p>We can quickly notice how there is a strange use of revolutionary language. We have a great vision, a distrustful establishment, a small guerrilla that pushes forward, armed with a great innovation. They succeeed, disrupting the existing order, making the world a better place.</p>
<p>Frankly, if one is bootstrapping a company, this narrative is inspiring and attractive. It may be necessary to be able to push forward when the odds are against you. But does it make sense to see the CEO of Meta talk like this? Microsoft? Uber, with an investor fund that is much greater than municipal taxi companies? The leading companies in an economic sector are the establishment. Why would they want to embrace a narrative than can bring them down?  </p>
<p>U.S. business embraces the language and narrative of innovation, and revolution, because it fears it. Big business can control markets, regulatory agencies, lawmakers, and judges. It can't control innovation, because the U.S. citizens can't stop innovatating. It is too grassroots. It happens everywhere. You see it universities; you find it in garages; in community workshops; even worse, in U.S. corporations, right under their noses.</p>
<p>Zeus becomes the ruler of Gods when he kills his father, Uranus. And then Zeus actively searches for the God destined to kill him and replace him. He learns from Prometheus that the son of Tethis is fated to be that God. So Zeus arranges for Tethis to marry a mortal, giving birth to Achilles, a mortal, thus avoiding the cycle of the child of a God destroying the current ruler. </p>
